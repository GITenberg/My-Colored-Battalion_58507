<h2 class="nobreak">MY COLORED BATTALION</h2></div>


<p>You have done me this honor tonight because
you know that I was the commander of a wonderful
fighting Infantry Battalion composed
entirely (myself excepted) of American colored
officers and colored men.</p>

<p>You know, too, that for some time, during
the Great World War, we were in the very
front lines of that magnificent wave of determined
Allies in France who held and at last
swept back the fiendish forces of autocracy
and tyranny and made it possible for liberty
loving people to continue their slow but steady
progress toward true Democracy.</p>

<p>You would like to hear a great deal about
that battalion from its white commander because
you know it was made up of brave men
and backed by brave women of your own color
who did their duty by you and by their country
and did it well. Your presence here and
the expression on your faces proves that you
are deeply, hopefully interested in the integrity
and in the advancement of your race.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>You would like to know something about me
as a soldier too, I suppose, because you have
been told I was the best friend the colored soldier
had. I am afraid that word <i>best</i> makes
it unjustly strong, for the colored soldier has
many white friends. Nevertheless, I am glad
I had the privilege and the opportunity to
prove that my efforts in the common cause,
the Allies&#8217; cause, were not one bit hampered
or lessened because my officers and men were
colored.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, there was no doubt
about the Americanism of my outfit, no question
of hyphens, no fear that their love for or
their hatred of some other nation exceeded
their love for our own. The devotion, the patriotism,
the loyalty of the American Negro
is beyond question. My only claim is that I
treated him justly&mdash;that&#8217;s all he needs or asks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Second Battalion of the Three Hundred
and Sixty-fifth United States Infantry (the
battalion we are considering) was a remarkable
organization, in many ways, in spite of
many things, a wonderful organization. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the battle line and out of the battle line, before
the armistice and after the armistice, there was
not a phase of military art or of the awful
game of war at which this battalion did not
excel. At going over the top, attacking enemy
positions, resisting raids and assaults, holding
under heavy shell fire, enduring gas of all
kinds, at patrolling no-man&#8217;s land, at drill, on
hard marches, in discipline and military courtesy,
at conducting itself properly in camp or
in French villages, and in general all around
snappiness, it excelled in all.</p>

<p>Much of this could be seen by going over
the battalion and regimental records. But the
greatest thing about that battalion is not a
matter of direct record in the written data and
reports. It is a matter of undying record in
the minds and hearts of the men who were that
battalion. I speak of the magnificent <i>morale</i>,
their mutual pride, their teamwork, their spirit
of earnest, cheerful willingness and their unsurpassed
endurance and bravery in the performance
of duty.</p>

<p>It will seem strange to most of you, almost
impossible to many who saw service in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
outfits, when I tell you that during my entire
service with the Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth
Infantry, which I began as a Captain in
December, 1917, and ended as a battalion commander
when the regiment was broken up at
Camp Upton, New York, in March, 1919, <i>not
one</i> colored officer under my command was ever
placed under arrest, and <i>not one</i> colored officer
was ever threatened with an efficiency board.
And during the many trying months that I
commanded the Second Battalion, both in and
out of the front lines, only two enlisted men
were tried by me as summary court&mdash;and they
were acquitted.</p>

<p>The same is true of the nine hundred officers
and men from all units of the regiment who
live in or near Chicago that I brought from
Camp Upton to be mustered out of service at
Camp Grant. Those of you who were in Chicago
remember how proudly the Camp Grant
Detachment of the Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth
Infantry paraded through the streets on
March 10th, 1919, without a hitch or a single
breach of discipline.</p>

<p>No doubt that is hard to believe, for it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
upset a host of time honored theories and teachings
and honest convictions about military discipline
and efficiency, but the facts as stated
can be verified. Members of that Battalion
and Regiment are right among you. Ask them.
These were by no means specially selected or
picked outfits. The officers and men were of
all kinds, all conditions, mostly draft men and
from all sections of the United States. They
were representative of their race as a whole,
yet in every instance a little company or military
police discipline or, in rare cases, a short
conference with the captain or major did the
work. Considering the excellent service rendered
by the units in question and especially
by the Second Battalion of that Regiment, I
regard this as a great tribute to our American
Colored Soldiers. There is much, very much
that is worthy of serious consideration about
the discipline, the efficiency and the morale of
that organization.</p>

<p>And now at the outset, before I go any further
with this lecture, I wish to tell you, my
colored friends, that I am proud to have been
the commander of that battalion. My talk necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
will be mostly about that Battalion,
for I commanded it during the Regiment&#8217;s
experience in the battle lines and during the
greater part of my service with the Division.
And now more than ever I believe, as I had
ample reason to believe then, that no battalion
of any army whether white or black or of some
other race or color could have done the same
things and done them any better than did the
Second Battalion of the Three Hundred and
Sixty-fifth Infantry, One Hundred and
Eighty-third Brigade, Ninety-second Division
of the United States Army in France.</p>

<p>It may interest you to know, especially after
what I have said about methods of securing
discipline&mdash;for results count&mdash;that I won my
commission as a major and what was far more,
my job as a front line infantry battalion commander
for efficiency under fire. I have a few
citations and letters and one signed testimonial
by white and colored officers who were witnesses,
for coolness, bravery and the like.
Thirty-five or forty officers and men were
cited for bravery in Division orders. Medals?
No, I have received no medals or special decorations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Nor has any living member, officer
or man, of my Battalion. In fact, to my
knowledge, not one living officer or man of
the entire Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth Infantry
has received any decoration or medal
of any sort whatever&mdash;American, French, Belgian
or any other kind. This, on the face of it,
to anyone who knows the facts, would seem
either a most glaring injustice or mistake.</p>

<p>Many of the members of my Battalion and
of the Regiment, especially those who were
with us at the time of the armistice and during
all or part of the awful days and weeks just
preceding it, feel and resent this most keenly.
In the army you know everything must go
through &#8220;military channels&#8221;&mdash;from company
to battalion to regiment to brigade to division
and on up. I recommended some of my officers
and men for decorations. And if I know anything
about meritorious conduct, real achievement,
bravery, valour and the like, they richly
deserved them. These recommendations
reached brigade headquarters. It is my opinion
that certain regular army officers saw fit to
head them off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Soon after the armistice we had a succession
of strange regimental commanders, who showed
no interest in pressing our case and so because
of a combination of unfortunate circumstances
the Regiment is medal-less. I understand our
Brigade has received some recognition. I do
not begrudge any officer or man his medal or
medals if he actually earned them, but I do
regret it that my Regiment and my own Battalion
could be thus ignored. You may believe
it or not when I say that I care nothing about
medals for myself. What little I did in the
cause of Democracy&mdash;by that I mean what I
did for my Colored Battalion as well as in trying
to help whip the enemy&mdash;is a matter with
me and my own better self.</p>

<p>The citations of which I am incomparably
more proud than of the citations I did get or the
medals I didn&#8217;t get were not printed with ink
nor stamped on metal. They were written with
a point of fire into the brave, true hearts of
my colored soldiers.</p>

<p>And who knows (if I may indulge in a little
sentiment)? Who can tell? Perhaps those who
bravely endured the tourtures of hell, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the foolishness of vain oppressors in this
wicked world and who uncomplainingly and unselfishly
gave all they had, all any one could
give&mdash;<i>gave their lives</i>&mdash;in defense of our great
nation and in the cause of Democracy. Perhaps,
I say, some of the spirits of that Battalion&#8217;s
dead have already whispered in the
glorious Realm beyond where the great, all-powerful
God of justice, of love, of peace reigns
supreme and with Whom man&#8217;s character is the
only thing that counts. Perhaps they have
whispered or will whisper, &#8220;Our Commander
not only braved the fury of the Hun, but he
scorned the petty prejudices of a few white
persons and treated <i>us</i> like officers and men.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Officers designated for service with the
Eighty-sixth Division, which was to be formed
at Camp Grant, Illinois, were ordered to report
for duty August, 28th, 1917. I so reported
and was assigned to the Three Hundred and
Forty-first Infantry. Being a captain I was
selected to command &#8220;G&#8221; Company. I received
my quota of the first drafted men to
arrive, on the second of September. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
continued to arrive and in a few weeks I had
two hundred and ninety-two men in addition to
my five training camp lieutenants. The new
organization had just gone into effect. Arms
and equipment arrived slowly. There was more
or less confusion; no one was right sure what to
do and a company commander had a real job
on his hands. Day and night I labored&mdash;drilled,
studied, taught, did paper work, and
then after three months or a little over, just
when I was beginning to pride myself, like all
the other captains, on having the best company
in the regiment, and when we were all seeing
visions of entraining for France, they began
transferring our men&mdash;thirty or forty from a
company at a time&mdash;to other divisions, and our
hearts sank.</p>

<p>I tried to get transferred myself, for like
many others, I wanted to soldier in France, not
at Camp Grant. Company commanders were
not being transferred to other camps, but just
before Christmas I was ordered to report to the
One Hundred and Eighty-third Brigade, a
part of which was attached at Camp Grant.
I was then assigned to the Three Hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Sixty-fifth Infantry, a regiment of that Brigade
and of the Ninety-second Division (colored).
I felt sure that the Ninety-second Division,
since it was the only complete colored
division, and there was not much danger of its
men being transferred, would go to France
long before the Eighty-sixth&mdash;and it did.</p>

<p>For a time I was with the supply company.
Then I was transferred to the headquarters
company, a rather uncertain and complicated
organization in those days, with an authorized
strength of seven officers and three hundred
and fifteen men. I remained with that company
until after our arrival in France.</p>

<p>In the infantry regiments of the Ninety-second
Division the lieutenants and captains were
colored with the exception of the regimental
staff captains and the captains of the headquarters
and supply companies. The majors
commanding the battalions and the lieutenant-colonel
and the colonel were old regular army
white officers.</p>

<p>We had been in training in France but a
short time when I was made regimental intelligence
and operations officer. Here again was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
another phase of the actual war game to learn.
I was in charge of a large number of selected
and specially trained men who made up the
intelligence and scout sections, and at the same
time was the regimental commander&#8217;s assistant
in preparing our own movements and operations.
I had direct charge of all that had to do
with our knowledge and information of the
enemy. I was also a member of the highest
division court-martial&mdash;the one that had power
to inflict the death penalty.</p>

<p>I received orders to take the battalion intelligence
and scout officers and part of the intelligence
and scout personnel into the line several
weeks ahead of the Division&#8217;s final arrival
there, to study and learn the sub-sector our
regiment was later to occupy. I was never sent
away to schools or on special missions and was
never on leave or in hospital but was on duty
with fighting troops continuously.</p>

<p>I have mentioned these things to show you
that I had had a large and varied experience
under the new army organization and in the
new methods of fighting that had developed
during the Great War. It was just the sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
training and experience to fit one for the hard
and responsible task of commanding an infantry
battalion in the front lines. I had been in
direct command of both white and colored officers
and men. I knew the colored enlisted man.
And I knew the recently-made colored officers
as well, fully as well, as did any white officer
in our army.</p>

<p>As I just said, I was sent into the lines ahead
of the Regiment to study the sector, learn about
the enemy opposite and about conditions in
general. When we arrived within hearing of
the big guns and a little later when our trucks
came within range just north of St. Die, I
was all interest and all attention, for at last I
was getting into the sort of place I had been
reading and thinking and wondering about
since 1914, and had been working and training
for every minute since I entered the training
camp at Fort Sheridan, May 10th, 1917. It&#8217;s
hard work getting ready to be killed in a modern
war.</p>

<p>The Regular Army Fifth Division, already
experienced in the line, was then holding this
sector. For several days I was busy at regimental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
headquarters located in what was left
of the village of Denipere. Then with the assistance
of guides, I started out to thoroughly
cover and learn the sector. This was by no
means a small task: it meant many miles of
walking and hard climbing for many days, to
say nothing of thrills and mental exercise. Our
boys had turned a quiet sector into a very
lively one and a few days before the Fifth Division
moved out they reduced and were partly
successful in holding the Chapelle salient.
Taken all in all it was somewhat exciting for
a novice exploring the very first lines.</p>

<p>There were three battalion fronts or sectors
in the front our regiment was to occupy. Each
of the three battalions had two companies in
front, one in support and one in reserve. The
companies were shifted every nine or ten days.
French artillery would be behind us. Ours was
in training near Bordeaux. The center battalion
sector was called C. R. Fontinelle. I
soon learned that it got most of the enemy&#8217;s
fire and raids because of the nature of the
terrain, meaning lay of the land. This would
be held by our Second Battalion, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had little idea then that I would soon command
it.</p>

<p>The entire front in France was divided into
battalion sectors or centers of resistance, called
C. R.&#8217;s. The battalion was the infantry fighting
unit in this war. When in the line, it had
everything attached to it to make it a complete
organization in itself&mdash;machine gun companies,
engineer troops, one pounder and Stokes mortar
outfits, supply equipment, medical personnel
and so on. Regimental and brigade fronts
varied in size and in the way they were held.
Often a regiment had but one battalion in front,
sometimes two and rarely three, as in our portion
of the St. Die sector.</p>

<p>There were three lines or systems of defense
in this sector. First, the front or first line system
of works and trenches, combat groups,
dugouts, communicating ways, machine gun
implacements, trench mortars, wire and, well,
it would take a long time to even name them all.
An entire evening easily could be spent telling
about any one little phase of the thing. From
two to three miles farther back in this sector
was the secondary lines or system with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
trenches, wire and everything, all ready for
occupancy. A little to the rear was most of the
light artillery. Several miles farther back was
the third line system and the heavy artillery.
The front line system was most interesting and
by far the most dangerous. There was this
about it, too: In case of enemy attack they
held. In other words, their occupants stayed
and fought to the last man. Those were standing
orders and at that time in my eyes it added
a sort of awful fascination to the front line
trenches and men.</p>

<p>One of the things that impressed me during
my first days in the line was the extent, the
magnitude of the works, the prodigious amount
of labor that had been required to excavate and
build these positions while under fire, the cutting
and tunneling in many places through solid
rock, also the military knowledge that had been
brought to bear in the locating and construction
of combat groups, observation posts, fields
of fire and the like and the amount of system
and pluck and energy required to hold them.
But one awful, ugly, discouraging word, from
a world standpoint, seemed written all over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
enterprise&mdash;Waste&mdash;waste of life, waste of
time, waste of governments&#8217; money, waste of
all those things misguided humanity loves and
fights for. What a shocking, what a saddening
lesson from the standpoint of <i>waste</i> alone!</p>

<p>Then as I became accustomed and somewhat
hardened to the idea of appalling and foolish
waste, another thing began to appeal to me
more strongly. The beauty of the scenery and
the invigorating air and sunshine of the mountains.
It was summer, radiant, glowing, glorious
summer. All nature vibrating and tingling
with life and kindness. The sky so bright, the
air so crisp, so bracing; the trees so green and
fresh. The flowers, the grass, even the weeds
and the very moss on the rocks seemed charged
and melodious with joy.</p>

<p>Little rivulets, cold and sparkling, leaped
over great boulders through shaded ravines
and joined the hilarious stream away below
which farther on, where the big ravine had
widened, calmly wound its way amid the ruins
of the quaint village called Denipere and out
through the wide valley beyond. And what a
panorama that valley was from the road on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mountainside north of the town, especially at
evening with the parting kiss of a great red
sun glowing on the winding river between its
green banks and its clumps of willows, and glistening
on the tile roofs of the remaining white
stone houses, the various colored fields and the
patches of wood, the white roads and their
rows of tall trees, the hills and shaded depressions,
and the gorgeous background of mountains
in the distance. It looked different each
time I viewed it, but always there was the
peaceful glow and glory of God&#8217;s handiwork.
Here, indeed, was La Belle France.</p>

<p>Many a time, at first, I used to forget myself,
lost in buoyant meditation, as I gazed
over that enchanting valley or walked along
the stately mountain roads enveloped in dense
foliage, or as I traveled down some secluded
pathway or lover&#8217;s lane beside a rippling brook,
inhaling deeply the pungent odor of growing
things and cool damp earth. Then, with a
start, I would come back to the realization that
those screaming shells, those metallic cracks,
those weird, jarring blasts were meant to
<i>mangle</i> and <i>kill</i>! That an enemy bent on destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was only a mile or so away; that
those glittering airplanes buzzing high above
were on missions of hate and murder; that
those little mounds I saw everywhere with
wooden crosses at one end were the graves of
fine young men who had been mangled and
slain by their fellow beings. All the surroundings
so inspiring, so beautiful; all nature so
smiling and so harmonious, and poor, deluded,
vain man so out of harmony. Somewhere,
somehow, something was wrong&mdash;terribly,
damnably wrong.</p>

<p>Then down in the very front lines in the
edge of the &#8220;abomination of desolation&#8221; called
no-man&#8217;s land, I watched those fine young men
of our Fifth Division, standing silently by their
automatics or rifles, gazing with ashen faces
and staring eyes over that torn dreaded expanse
that separated them from a cunning and
deadly foe, and gradually my feelings changed
from happiness due to health, the mountain air
and the charms of nature, to feelings of depression
and sadness, and hatred toward those who
advocate and perpetuate in their blind vanity
and self-righteous greed those principles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
policies that lead to strife, to heart-ache and to
war.</p>

<p>Here, accentuated by the glories of nature,
was the horror of war and the awful proof of
the degradation of humanity&mdash;despite its so-called
Christian civilization.</p>

<p>Graves and danger and death. Death over
head, death under foot, death in every direction&mdash;suffering,
loneliness, longing, agony, death&mdash;<i>Death!</i>
But the greedy fiends really responsible
were not there. And a sort of awe came
over me and a feeling of tender pity for those
brave, unselfish men, mere boys, many of them,
standing silently, majestically&mdash;facing death
in those front line trenches.</p>

<p>Time passed quickly, for like all officers of
our army who entered the lines, regardless of
previous training, I had very much to learn.
There was so much to wonder and think about,
too, for my job took me to all parts of our
sector and necessitated a careful study of the
enemy. For example, I had soon noticed that
the men of units occupying the most dangerous
positions and suffering the greatest inconvenience
and strain seemed most care free and calm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
There was an expression on their faces, an atmosphere
about them that had not been there
during the training period behind the lines.
This opened great fields for thought, and I&#8217;m
still thinking.</p>

<p>Then one day, before I realized that it was
time, I saw little groups of blue-clad soldiers&mdash;the
soldiers of France, standing about in Denipere,
and on the roads I saw more little groups;
next day there were more, and the following
morning, as though it had happened by magic,
I found the entire position, front lines and all,
occupied and held by those quiet, tired-faced,
sturdy heroes of France. The boys of our
Fifth Division had moved out during the night.
The following night my regiment moved in.
The French infantry left several days later
when we had become established in our position.
A short time after that I was placed in command
of our Second Battalion, holding the center
sector called C. R. Fontinelle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The day I took command the enemy put over
one of his famous raids. For two and one-half
hours he laid a heavy concentrated fire on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Second Battalion&#8217;s front line system, then
changed it into an almost perfect box barrage
around the two front companies and jumped us
through our left flank. The raiding was done
by one of their notorious, specially-trained
shock battalions sent to the sector for that purpose.
By excellent work on the part of the two
front companies and the support company assisted
by a company of engineers, they were
soon driven out. They managed to drag most
of their dead and wounded with them, but left
considerable equipment including several machine
guns they had brought over and set up in
our trenches.</p>

<p>It would take all evening to tell about that
one action, or Fontinelle Raid, alone. There
is so much I could tell you about my Battalion,
funny things, as well as serious, to say nothing
of our Division or the French soldiers and
people and what not, that I hardly know what
to tell.</p>

<p>But I do know we haven&#8217;t much time so I
think we&#8217;ll make a long jump, skipping things
equally interesting, the bombardments, the patrols,
the raids, the experiences and trials at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Fontinelle, then the hard marches, the sleepless,
shelterless nights in cold rain and mud, the
hardships of the Argonne and our part during
the early days of that famous American drive,
our tiresome movement from that front and our
taking over from the French on the night of
October 6th and 7th of C. R. Musson, an important
section of the Marbache sector&#8217;s front,
on the east bank of the Moselle River just south
and a little west of Metz.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll pass over the many interesting and trying
happenings and experiences of the thirty-one
straight days&mdash;intense, nerve-racking days
and nights that we occupied that position, and
take it up a few days before the armistice, or
just before the preliminary to the long-talked
of drive for Metz. I&#8217;ll only have time to tell
you briefly of a small part of that, but perhaps
you may gain some faint realization of how the
boys fought and suffered and won.</p>

<p>First, just a few words to show you the way
in which the Ninety-second Division had taken
over and held the Marbace sector. At three
o&#8217;clock on the morning of October 6th, after
marching all night, the Second Battalion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth Infantry arrived
at Aton, a village about three miles behind
the front lines. All that day I spent at
the front with the commander of the French
battalion then holding the C. R. During the
afternoon my officers and part of the non-coms.
came up and went over the positions assigned
them. That night we stealthily moved in and
the French moved out.</p>

<p>This was a key position. Through it, varying
from two to five hundred yards from the
bank of the river, ran what was known as the
Great Metz Road. We held a front of about a
mile and a half. I wish I had a big map or a
blackboard and time to show you. I can see it
all now as plainly as if I were there. Across
the Moselle adjoining us on our left at that
time was a white division. About two weeks
before the armistice the C. R. next to us and
adjoining the river, was taken over and occupied
by a battalion of the Three Hundred
and Sixty-seventh Infantry of our Division.
The C. R. on our right was taken over the night
following our arrival by the First Battalion of
our Regiment. The First and Third Battalions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
took turns holding that C. R. The Three hundred
and Sixty-sixth Infantry kept one battalion
in line on their right. Adjoining it were
the French. Our own division artillery got
into position behind us only a few days before
the end. At first our Division had three battalions,
and during the last two weeks, four
battalions in the front line. We held a front
line section several times as long as did any
other battalion of the Division, in the Marbache
sector. Thirty-one straight days was a long,
hard stretch for a battalion in an important and
far from quiet front or first line position.</p>

<p>Finally, on the night of November 6th-7th
we were at last moved back about five miles to
the second line of defense. The officers and
men were almost completely worn out, many of
them bordering on nervous collapse. But even
now the Battalion was to get no rest. On the
7th, in compliance with orders from the Commanding
General, we put over an operation in
which &#8220;H&#8221; Company and half of &#8220;E&#8221; went
over the top, and on the 8th I was up in front
again on very short notice in command of a
daylight contact patrol in which I used all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
&#8220;F&#8221; Company, half of &#8220;G&#8221; and part of the
regimental machine gun company.</p>

<p>So during those two days in the second line,
instead of resting, almost the entire Battalion
had been all the way back up to the front, over
the top, and back again. These were small but
extremely trying&mdash;tired as we were&mdash;and also
rather costly operations. I say small&mdash;I mean
comparatively small as to the numbers of officers
and men engaged, but to the individual
engaged they were large, quite large. A number
were killed and many wounded, including
two captains, Mills, commanding &#8220;F&#8221; Company,
and Cranson, commander of &#8220;G.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Battalion had caught most of the hell
in the St. Die sector, had done its full share
in the Argonne, though, due to the fortunes of
war, I suppose, little if any mention is made
of it, and in the Marbache sector had held the
most important C. R. continuously up to the
night of the 6th and 7th, and after the operations
of the 7th and 8th just mentioned, you
can judge what condition my outfit was in on
the morning of November 9th.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on the morning of November<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
9th, I received word that the Commanding
General had just arrived at Regimental Headquarters
in Loisey and wished to see me at once.
So, dog-tired, aching all over and dead for
sleep, I got into a sidecar and went back. Just
as I expected, he handed me an order, Brigade
order, that had been sanctioned by Division
Headquarters, G. H. Q., and the High Allied
Command covering our Brigade&#8217;s part in the
inauguration or preliminary to the Metz drive.
It started something like this: &#8220;Major Warner
A. Ross, commanding the Second Battalion,
Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth Infantry,
will at five o&#8217;clock on the morning of November
10th, attack enemy positions&mdash;named
them&mdash;to the east of the Moselle River, will
advance to the northern edge of Bois Frehaut
and to such and such a point on the river bank
and hold until further orders,&#8221; etc. That evening
I received a similar order, changed somewhat
from the first one, but what it all meant
was that it was up to us&mdash;the Battalion&mdash;to
capture and above all to hold this strong key
position just up the river from Metz.</p>

<p>In so far as we were concerned it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
frontal attack on the general position of Metz.
How far the Allies intended or expected to
drive straight on toward Metz I do not know.
The long advance was to be southeast of us with
the idea of eventually isolating Metz. Judging
by what happened to us and to the attackers
on our flanks during the tenth and eleventh,
it would have been foolish, if not impossible,
to advance further along the Moselle. That is
why the capturing and holding of Bois Frehaut
was especially glorious.</p>

<p>The generals commanding our Division and
Brigade seemed very anxious that this operation
prove a success. Up to this time the Division
had not accomplished anything very startling
in the way of capturing German strongholds,
but here, before the expected armistice
went into effect, was an opportunity to prove
the Division&#8217;s ability and worth and refute any
whisperings that might be in the air. In other
words, to quote one of my high ranking superiors,
full and real success here would forever
give the division a leg to stand on.</p>

<p>Mine, then, was the honor of being in direct
command of the main operation which started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the long discussed Allied move to capture Metz,
said to be the most impregnable German
stronghold. Mine, too, was the opportunity to
give a colored battalion a chance to prove its
worth beyond all peradventure, to help them
disprove the widely circulated report that colored
troops could not advance and hold under
real and prolonged heavy fire, to help them
dispel the impression so many had that colored
officers&mdash;platoon leaders and company commanders&mdash;could
not successfully handle colored
soldiers. In short, to give them a chance to
win a victory that will stand out more clearly
as the years go by, a victory requiring all the
virtues that soldiers, individually and collectively
should possess&mdash;a victory clear cut, unaided,
complete and unquestionable, where
others had failed and against a stronghold, a
part of and guarding a strategic position that
at all hazards the enemy meant to hold.</p>

<p>The Second Battalion of the Three Hundred
and Sixty-fifth Infantry was chosen, despite
its long and continuous work in the front
lines, its greatly depleted ranks and shortness
of officers. Reinforced by other units, other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
men and other officers of the Three Hundred
and Sixty-fifth Infantry, the Second Battalion
at last met its supreme test&mdash;its golden opportunity.
I shall try briefly to tell you what it
did, for &#8220;Bois Frehaut,&#8221; under the guns of
Metz, will remain a memorial to the discipline,
the efficiency, the bravery, and devotion to duty
of an American colored battalion.</p>

<p>The Three Hundred and Sixty-seventh Infantry,
as previously mentioned, had recently
taken over one battalion sector or C. R. just
across the river. They, too, had orders to advance.
A battalion of the white division on
their left also was to advance. On our right a
small part of a battalion (to be exact, two platoons&mdash;about
half of one company) of the
Three Hundred and Sixty-sixth Infantry was
to advance through our Third Battalion, then
occupying that C. R.</p>

<p>I may as well tell you, what many people
know, that although this was the beginning of
the great Allied movement to reduce the strategic
stronghold of Metz, with division after division
massing behind us and to our right, the
battalion of the white division to the left of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Three Hundred and Sixty-seventh rushed
ahead at zero hour on the morning of the 10th,
lost one hundred and fifty-six men in less than
five minutes and withdrew to their trenches.
The attack battalion of the Three Sixty-seventh
sized up the situation and barely left their
trenches so withering was the fire.</p>

<p>The troops of a part of a battalion of the
Three Hundred and Sixty-sixth on our right
rushed out to take a small wood that laid east
of the positions we were to take, got almost
to their objectives and rushed back owing to
the accuracy and intensity of enemy fire. But
it didn&#8217;t matter much outside of leaving my
battalion&#8217;s right flank entirely wide open, for
Bois de la tete d&#8217;Or and Bois Frehaut of our
position far outflanked it and made it untenable
for the Germans. A map of the positions
involved tells the story. I tell you this not to
discredit or belittle units on our right and left,
but to prove that what the Second Battalion
of the Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth Infantry
there accomplished was far from easy and
that when it came to defending Metz the
enemy was decidedly on the job.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Bois Frehaut is a hilly, dense wood about
five hundred yards east of the Moselle River,
rising from low, flat, boggy land. This low
ground extends around and eastward south of
the wood, between it and the northern edge
of East Pont-a-Musson, in the form of a
broad swale gradually narrowing and rising
from a point south of the center of the wood.
This broad swale was no-man&#8217;s land. Behind
Bois Frehaut to the north enemy ground continued
to rise, culminating in a very high hill
or mountain overlooking the wood, no-man&#8217;s
land, Pont-a-Musson and the entire country
for miles around. Near its summit was an
exceptionally fine observation post, reached by
a long tunnel.</p>

<p>In speaking of the action of Bois Frehaut
or the capture of Bois Frehaut the places called
Belle Aire Farm, Bois de la Tete d&#8217;Or and
Ferme de Pence are included. They are parts
of and join Bois Frehaut. This position was a
separate and distinct place entirely surrounded
by clear ground and most ideally situated for
the enemy for defense purposes. My knowledge
of what was done by units on our right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and left was gained during the action through
my efforts to keep in touch with and to establish
liaison with those units on our flanks.</p>

<p>On three separate occasions during the preceding
four months Allied troops had attempted
to capture this Bois Frehaut. Once
a French outfit, after considerable artillery
preparation, got into the edge of it by a turning
movement and stayed about ten minutes.
Later French Senegalese troops penetrated
its east flank a short distance and stayed less
than one hour. At the time American troops
reduced the St. Mihiel Salient they made a
frontal attack on Bois Frehaut and Ferme de
Belle Aire, an outpost position in front of and
about half as wide as the wood proper. This
advance or pinch was supposed to start east
of Bois Frehaut and take it with the big salient,
but it had to pivot on Bois Frehaut instead of
straightening the line from Momeny, for this
was near Metz and one of the strong outlying
centers defending it, so the attackers never got
through the outside systems of wire. As a result
of this the Allied first line on the west side
of the river was several kilometers in advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of our line on the east bank before we took
Bois Frehaut and straightened it. I remember
that as we went through the Ferme de Belle
Aire wire I counted twenty-six American bodies
or parts of bodies in one small section. They
had been lying or hanging there since about
September 13th.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the position the Second Battalion
of the Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth
Infantry, short two captains and nine lieutenants,
its ranks badly thinned and the whole
outfit dead tired, was ordered to capture and
to hold. This was the morning of the ninth,
the companies were widely separated, we were
almost five miles behind our front line and we
were to attack at five o&#8217;clock the next morning.</p>

<p>There was not a minute to lose. Early in the
afternoon we were up in East Pont-a-Musson.
We would spend the night completing our
preparations there. Our first lines at the point
where I had decided to leave them were just
north of the edge of the town. From there,
for several kilometers, they ran in a north-easterly
direction, but my orders called for a
<i>head-on</i> attack along the entire enemy front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Prospective casualties for us seemed not to
concern those of my superiors and their assistants
who had laid down the general outline for
this affair and for several previous affairs. I
haven&#8217;t time here to go into details as to that
statement, but I assure you I am not telling
anything imaginative or that I can not substantiate.
I am saying little or nothing of any
battalion or organization other than my own.
What I say of it and things pertaining to it
are not meant to apply to anything else. They
are the result of personal knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>The commanding General had wished me
luck and departed. The Lieutenant Colonel
practically had put the regiment at my disposal
and gone to Loisey. The whole thing
was now up to us. There were a thousand
things to think of and do and very little time
in which to do them. I called the officers together
and gave instructions about equipment
of all sorts&mdash;ammunition, gas masks, sag paste,
rations&mdash;things that had to be sent back for,
and so on.</p>

<p>I sent for certain units of the Headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Company, and annexed a part of the officers
and men of the First Battalion. By the way,
its Major had been killed by the Germans a
few days before. I also sent for the Regimental
Machine Gun Company, for I had a foreboding
that the company of the Brigade Machine Gun
Battalion designated to report to me in the
orders would not arrive in time. So I played
safe. Then I spent about two hours inspecting
and watching the preparations go forward. At
six P. M. I sat down to study in detail and
to systematize our plan of attack. Everything
must be thought out and arranged in advance.
All contingencies must, if possible, be foreseen
and provided for. The foe we were going
against was highly organized and knew his
position. He was experienced, efficient and
crafty in the art of war.</p>

<p>Promptly at eight-thirty, as ordered, the
officers assembled at the house we were using
as temporary Battalion Headquarters. The
company from the Machine Gun Battalion had
not arrived and for what we were about to undertake,
machine guns were important. So I
called Captain Allen and his lieutenants of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Regimental Machine Gun Company into the
conference. Had the other company arrived,
Captain Allen of the company I had sent for
on my own initiative, probably would not now
be lying buried in France. So works fate, as
some call it. It&#8217;s a sad thing to have to order
officers and men on missions of almost certain
death, especially when they are so willing, even
anxious to go, and when you know them as well
as I knew mine, but such is war.</p>

<p>For hours in a dimly candle-lighted room we
worked. Studied charts and blue prints,
planned each move of each detachment and
platoon in detail. Company and platoon commanders
laid their courses, drew maps and
studied them carefully, for they would have to
travel independently and by compass after
entering enemy wire. We carefully rehearsed
our plans of liaison. In short, every detail was
gone over; all emergencies we could conceive
of were discussed, so that each captain and
each platoon leader (some were non-coms.)
knew his part and its relation to the whole.
Each one explained aloud just what he was to
do and when and how, and how such and such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
developments were to affect his actions. For
you must know that nothing but well-nigh
faultless team work would enable us to accomplish
our mission.</p>

<p>To capture and to hold this strong and seemingly
impregnable key position under the big
guns of the world renowned fortress of Metz,
to say nothing of its other means of defense,
with but one battalion and but five minutes&#8217;
artillery preparation, did not mean to rush out
with a whoop and sweep all before us. It required
a thorough, practical knowledge gained
by experience of all the complicated phases of
trench and open warfare. It required officers
and non-commissioned officers of iron nerve
and cool judgment under fire, and brave troops
of exceptional discipline and the finest training.
Whether those higher up expected us to succeed
or could have expected any battalion to
succeed, I doubted. So I had made up my
mind we would succeed.</p>

<p>At one thirty-five A. M. I received word by
telephone from the Brigade Adjutant that
Zero hour would be seven o&#8217;clock instead of
five. At three A. M. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
you over and into that place. I&#8217;ll be with you
and I&#8217;m going to <i>stick</i>. I&#8217;ll never come back
except on orders from proper authority unless
carried back unconscious or dead. This meeting
is adjourned.&#8221; For fully a minute they remained
perfectly still&mdash;not one moved. Then
one at a time they got up, shook my hand and
filed out into the cold and darkness&mdash;the vast,
ominous outdoors. And I knew then by the
look on each leader&#8217;s face that we would be
annihilated or win.</p>

<p>They roused their men, for they had been
ordered to get what rest they could, and there
in the chill and dead of night, explained to
them just what was to be done; explained each
man&#8217;s part, for each man has a part in a job
like that. Certain things had arrived during
the night. These were distributed, final inspections
were made and by five o&#8217;clock all was in
readiness for the start. The four companies
of infantry, &#8220;H,&#8221; &#8220;G,&#8221; &#8220;E&#8221; and &#8220;F,&#8221; the Regimental
Machine Gun Company, the One-Pounder
and Stokes Mortar Platoons, the
Pioneer Platoon and Signal outfits from the
Headquarters Company, the specialty detachments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
from Division Headquarters, the Doctors
and Stretcher Bearers&mdash;all were there
lined up in battalion front, at increased intervals,
along the great Metz road.</p>

<p>For a moment I paused, feeling or sensing,
as it were, my Battalion, for I could see only
the shadowy forms of a few who were nearest.
I wondered if those at home knew or could
have any realization of what these men were
doing and suffering for them. All through
that awful night I had heard not one word of
complaint. Not a grumble had reached my
ears, and I smiled as I remembered the many
times before, even away back in the Argonne
or St. Die (it seemed ages ago then), how,
when I had approached within hearing of disconsolate
looking groups of men, shivering all
night long, perhaps in deep mud and cold rain,
because of mistakes higher up or for unavoidable
causes, some old fellow in the group had
started to sing or said some silly thing intended
to be funny and how all the others had <i>laughed</i>&mdash;for
my benefit. And these were the men I
was about to lead out there where it looked to
all of us like sure annihilation. These were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
remnant of that Battalion, and I&mdash;, but the
hour had come.</p>

<p>I started at the right of the line, which would
be the rear when they swung into column, followed
by my Adjutant, Lieutenant Pritchard.
It was just before dawn, that most spookey
and shivery of all hours&mdash;a few degrees above
freezing, but the cold, fleecy mist that enveloped
us seemed to penetrate our very bones. Just
enough light was filtering through for me to
recognize each officer and man as I walked
slowly close to the line. Not a word was spoken&mdash;not
a sound, save the never tearing <i>screech</i>
of an occasional shell with its ugly blast, or
the rattling, echoing <i>tat, tat, tat-a-tat!</i> of a
machine gun or an automatic rifle in the distance.</p>

<p>Along the whole wide front I moved&mdash;sadly,
looking into the face of each man, each so busy
with his thoughts. How pinched, how tired&mdash;how
worn they looked. Many cheeks were wet
with tears. Each man made an effort to smile.
Many chins and lips trembled. The very chill
and the darkness seemed charged and potent
with <i>death</i>. But every head was high. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
form was rigidly erect. &#8220;They are just great
children,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;so proud in their sacrifice,
so brave, so true in this awful preliminary hour&mdash;great
trusting, innocent boys suffering for
the sins and for the sakes of others, and mine
the sad, oh, <i>unspeakably sad</i>, duty of leading
them to death, or to horrors and suffering even
worse.&#8221; Had I not been going <i>with</i> them I
could not have faced them then. I reached the
end of the line. My staff and runners fell in
behind me. The Captain of the leading company
gave a signal, repeated down the line.
They swung&mdash;&#8220;<i>Squads left!</i>&#8221; And the Death
March had begun.</p>

<p>No band was playing, no colors flying, no
loved ones and friends admiring, cheering&mdash;just
on through the ghastly night&mdash;and I could
feel the very heart beat of those twelve hundred
and fifty brave men behind me as plainly as I
could hear the muffled tread of their hob-nailed
shoes. For I loved that Battalion. It was the
pride of my life. And there was not one among
all those hundreds of big, black heroes of mine
that would not have gone through <i>hell</i> for his
Major. And no one knew it better than I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>On, on, thump, thump, thump, up the familiar
road, under the great bare trees, past the
deserted, shell marked houses, and damp, tomb-like
ruins that had once been happy homes.
Then we were in the outskirts of the town.
On the left was the arch, the big iron gate
and the ruined house under which were the dugouts
of the battalion infirmary. Soon we were
passing the Battalion graveyard to our right,
with its rows of mounds and wooden crosses
barely discernible.</p>

<p>And strangely enough, at a time like this, I
thought of one very dark night, much darker
than this, with flares and star shells and colored
rockets lighting no-man&#8217;s land, not far away,
and the flash and roar of big guns and screaming
shells, when we buried our first man there,
killed the night we first moved into the sector.
And I remembered how helpless and small he
seemed as they gently laid him in his shallow
grave, and then when we bent near to conceal
the brief glare of a pocket flashlight, how <i>proud</i>
he looked, with a great hole through his chest
torn by a flying chunk of jagged steel, and
only a blanket for a coffin, and the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of peace on the young black face, for he had
stuck and died at his post. And then when the
little, muddy grave was filled, how pitiful and
how lonely he seemed, as we left him to darkness
in that blood soaked foreign soil&mdash;so far
from his loved ones and home.</p>

<p>Like thousands in that hellish war, he had
made the supreme sacrifice, had unflinchingly
laid down his life to save others. He was a
true American soldier. I hope they still keep
flowers on his grave.</p>

<p>I could see the very mound there on the end
as we passed, for already a faint, cold brightness
was breaking through the mist. On we
marched, up and off the road, through the
labyrinth of grave-like trenches, till at last we
reached the broad maze of our most advance
wire. New paths or openings had just been
cut and men of the Battalion Scout Platoon
were waiting to guide us through.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was still impossible to see more than
twenty-five or thirty yards through the fog, so
with compass in hand I led the column through
no-man&#8217;s land like a skipper would pilot a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
ship, among shell holes, through small gulleys,
clumps of scrubby brush and patches of dead
weeds, and as we neared and entered enemy
wire, past ghastly, stinking objects that reminded
us most keenly of the attempts our
predecessors had made to do what we had to
do. I also reflected, when I saw the head drop
off of one as a man jarred the wire it hung over,
that my own carcass or the carcasses of a king
or even a queen, or of some wealthy notable,
would look no better if it had been lying or
hanging out in the weather for about two months
with these horrible objects that had once been
fine young American soldiers. (During the
time we occupied the sector patrols had brought
in and we had buried a number of these bodies.)</p>

<p>There was almost a mile of no-man&#8217;s land at
the point where we had crossed it, for we traveled
on the lowest ground because the mist was
denser there. But at last we had come to the
acres of wire before the enemy outpost position
called Belle Aire Farm, in French &#8220;Ferme de
Belle Aire.&#8221; This was several hundred yards
in advance of Bois Frehaut, the main position,
which occupied higher and rising ground. Part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the battalion, led by Captain Green of &#8220;H&#8221;
Company, which was to lead on the right,
moved around to the east to take their places
ready for the attack. The rest cut through the
Belle Aire wire, one detachment cutting in on
the flank to <i>bayonet</i> machine gunners, for we
worked quietly at this stage, and we worked
fast, taking advantage of the now rapidly thinning
mist. This whole thing had been planned
by us to outguess the enemy and in so far
as possible to avoid casualties, for dead and
wounded men can not take and hold positions
such as that.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I saw two of my
men knocked over by machine gun fire, the first
to fall in this affair, and as we hugged the
ground waiting for our flanking party to reward
those machine gunners, I could have dictated
quite a story, had there been any one to
take it down, on the subject of Militarism and
War in general. I wondered how many wars
there&#8217;d be and how long they&#8217;d last if the people
who profit by them or hope to profit by them
had to be up there with us. I was in a nasty
mood, as I usually was, when I thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
most any phase of the war except of the glorious
men who personally faced the <i>real</i> danger
and who did the actual fighting. I doubt
whether that story, as I would have dictated it
then, would be very popular with people who
didn&#8217;t honestly and actually suffer in or because
of the war, or with those who think they
believe in militarism and war.</p>

<p>We were not delayed long. Then with Belle
Aire Farm behind us, we rapidly deployed and
took up our formation in platoon and half
platoon columns facing and about one hundred
yards from the wire of the main position. The
entire command took cover in shell holes, in
depressions, behind mounds or clusters of dead
weeds ready to spring forward in force at the
proper moment. I had time to make sure that
all was in readiness as planned and get back to
the center. The mist had lifted and enemy machine
gunners near the edge of the wood, especially
those with nests in trees, were blazing
away recklessly.</p>

<p>Promptly at six fifty-five (all watches had
been synchronized) our big guns, miles behind
us, almost simultaneously began to bark and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
boom. Then came the shells, a low moaning
roar at first, the sound rising in pitch something
like a slowly operated steam siren whistle, then
increasing in volume and shrillness till it
seemed like a mighty tornado coming right at
us. The noise was so great and so sudden that
it was almost unbearable. Then they began to
explode all along, most of them just in front of
us. Words are utterly inadequate to describe
this awful cataclysm as it felt and seemed to us.</p>

<p>We had figured that the enemy would drop
his barrage first in front of Belle Aire Farm.
That&#8217;s why we had gotten through that position
so hastily and it was fortunate that we advanced
as far as we did even at the risk of being
too close to our own barrage, for almost immediately
the dirt and rocks began to fly behind us&mdash;not
in front of the Belle Aire wire, but right
on the position itself. Some one had been telephoning.
We were too close to our own barrage,
but I knew it would advance in a few
minutes, and the enemy barrage was entirely too
close behind us. Talk about being between two
fires. A curtain of fire from our own artillery
just ahead of us and a wall of the most intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and concentrated fire from batteries guarding
Metz falling immediately in our rear, the shells
passing each other not far above our heads. A
few from each side fell short.</p>

<p>To be killed or rendered unconscious is easy,
but to have to live through a situation like that
right out in the open is beyond all power to
describe. Our chances for survival and success
hung in the balance, the suspense was maddening.
The enemy barrage would soon be lowered
in front of the main wire&mdash;right where we
were. It might be lowered any second. I decided
that if he lowered it we would rush into
our own barrage rather than stay where we
were, for as many of us as possible must get
through that wire.</p>

<p>I kept looking at my watch, ready to give the
signal that would be relayed along our line. It
was six fifty-eight, then finally six fifty-eight
and a half; at last it got to be six fifty-nine. If
that enemy barrage lowered then, our casualties
would be enormous and our chances for success
almost gone. It was bad enough as it was.
That was the longest minute I ever spent.</p>

<p>Promptly at seven, as scheduled, our barrage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
jumped and in a few seconds practically
all of our shells were falling beyond the wire.
This was our time to get through and quickly,
if ever. All along the front our boys went for
those entanglements. Talk about wire entanglements.
They had recently been repaired
and strengthened. Most of the wire was the
heavy new German type, with barbs an inch
and a half long and less than an inch apart. It
required heavy two-handed cutters with handles
two and a half feet long to cut it. Small cutters
were useless for cutting here. The wide
belts were not only criss-crossed back and forth
in all directions on stakes and on chevaux-de-frise,
but woven in every conceivable way as
high as a man&#8217;s head back among the trees.</p>

<p>There were pits and trenches with wire
thrown in loose and in coils covered with light
limbs and leaves for men to fall into. We had
no tanks. They set off mines, many of which
blew holes sixty to seventy feet in diameter.
Grenades and bombs were suspended from
limbs and in the brush in such a way that stepping
on or touching a certain stick or wire
would explode them. Machine guns were placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
at varying distances back in the wood, some on
little camouflaged platforms in trees, some in
trenches and some in cement &#8220;pill boxes&#8221; located
so as to sweep and enfilade every section
of the wire.</p>

<p>High ranking officers from the rear as well
as low ranking ones who swarmed up to visit
the place after the armistice were amazed at the
strength of the position, and when they saw it
at close range the predominant question was,
&#8220;How did they ever get through?&#8221; And they
only saw it from the outside edge, for no one
was allowed into the wood. It was saturated
with gas for days.</p>

<p>The entire Bois Frehaut, which means Frehaut
Woods, was wired every few hundred
yards in front of trench systems and enfilading
machine guns. There were deep rocky ravines,
steep hills, large patches of heavy undergrowth
filled with wire, traps, mines and pitfalls of
every description, also magnificent dugouts and
a most complete system of &#8217;phone and signal
lines.</p>

<p>The platoons and half platoons went through
in single file, strong men in front taking turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
at cutting wire and those behind bending back
or securing the loose ends as well as possible
with the small cutters. There was from a hundred
and fifty to two hundred yards interval
between detachments. It was impossible for
them to see each other after entering the wood,
so that until their objectives were reached each
outfit to all intents and purposes was an independent
command.</p>

<p>Practically every one had penetrated the
first or outer entanglements when the enemy
laid his barrage right on us. The first men
through were going after the machine guns and
snipers that were bothering them most, crawling
around behind or flanking them, using hand
grenades and bayonets, firing with automatic
rifles and taking pot shots at those in trees.
Being through the first system of wire we
could scatter somewhat and take advantage of
shell holes, trenches, even hollows.</p>

<p>But how any one lived under that fire is still
a mystery to me. Enemy artillery had gotten
word by telephone or airplane, probably both,
that we were into the wood, and had decided to
end us right there. Stones, dirt, shrapnel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
limbs and whole trees filled the air. The noise
and concussion alone were enough to kill one.
Talk about shell shock. The earth swayed and
shook and fairly bounced with the awful impact.
Flashes of fire, the metallic crack of high
explosives, the awful explosions that dug holes
fifteen and twenty feet in diameter, the utter
and complete pandemonium and the stench of
hell, your friends blown to bits, the pieces dropping
near&mdash;even striking you. If anything can
be more terrifying, more nerve-breaking in this
world than a concentrated fire from heavies
such as that, I am unable to conceive of it. It&#8217;s
many times worse than the worst thing one can
imagine. It can&#8217;t be described because there is
nothing you have experienced, unless the thing
itself, with which to compare it.</p>

<p>There were many guns defending Metz and
this was a concentration of heavy caliber fire&mdash;we
were the only ones advancing just then.
After what seemed a lifetime he lowered it still
more to the point where our barrage was dropping
ahead of us, then it slowly crept back
over us to the Belle Aire wire. Several times
it passed over us, rather on us, in this combing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
process, before we reached our goal. Other
batteries were shelling our back areas and still
others were shelling us promiscuously.</p>

<p>But the boys kept on, taking advantage of
any available cover at times, but resuming,
silencing machine guns that still were active,
bombing dugouts and bayoneting or shooting
all the enemy that had lingered too long. Only
by special effort did I secure three live Huns.</p>

<p>By nine thirty-five all platoons assigned to
the first line, but two, were represented on the
line of our objectives. As prearranged this
word reached me through runners. The two
outfits had been delayed by machine gun nests,
but they soon came up. By ten o&#8217;clock liaison
was fully established, combat groups had been
located and were digging in, machine guns and
trench mortars were being placed, and in other
ways we were getting ready to withstand counter
attacks as well as artillery fire, which, if we
held, soon would include more gas. I had sent
two platoons of the support company to help
protect our right flank, which was the eastern
edge of the wood.</p>

<p>So I wrote a message, put it into the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
aluminum shell on the leg of a pigeon. The
man released him and we watched him rise and
circle, then head southward with word for the
Commanding General fifteen miles back at
Division Headquarters in Marbache that Bois
Frehaut was ours&mdash;all objectives reached, were
holding and would continue to hold.</p>

<p>Then I took my staff and Artillery Liaison
officers and my runners and went back to a prearranged
locality in the edge of the wood and
established my permanent headquarters or P. C.
in an open shell hole. A few men set to
work with spades and picks to shape it up and
give it a little level floor space.</p>

<p>A Bosch airplane appeared over the edge
of the wood flying low and saw us. He circled
a few times and dropped out some signals. In
just four minutes by my watch we heard two
big shells, one just behind the other, coming
right at us. After a few months&#8217; experience
you get so you can tell from the sound just
about where a shell is going to hit. One of these
struck twenty-five yards beyond us, the other
almost the same distance to our left. In less
than a minute we heard two more coming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
same route. One struck twenty yards short,
the other not quite so short, but a little to the
right. They had the range. The guns were
five and a half or six miles away.</p>

<p>After the sixth shot had just missed I ordered
everybody out of the hole. They occupied
others a short distance away. The airplane,
so low that the men were shooting at it
with their rifles, noted this scattering, but he
evidently noted, too, that I had remained, so
the firing continued. I felt a sort of pride
about sticking to my headquarters. The thirty-sixth
shell fired at it struck right near the edge
and covered me up. Oh, yes, I was given energetic
assistance in getting out. We cleaned
out the hole and resumed business. Now that
the airplane had signaled &#8220;a hit&#8221; and gone, it
was as safe as any other place in that locality.</p>

<p>People said it seemed miraculous that with
so many big shells fired at it and hitting on all
sides in such a small area, each one had failed
to hit directly in that big hole. But I was not
conceited enough to think that the Huns were
firing shells that curved by magic for my special
benefit. I had estimated during the &#8220;Death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
March&#8221; just before dawn that I had one chance
in three of coming through that operation alive
and one in twelve of escaping serious wounds
or gassing. I believed in God all right, but I
did not think then and do not now believe that
He was down there taking an active part in
that horrible orgy of suffering and destruction.
I felt that if anything other than vain humanity
was fighting on or with either side it must be
his Satanic Majesty. I was not trying to palm
off on God the things that be Caesar&#8217;s. However&mdash;well,
that calls for another lecture. But
don&#8217;t any of you get an idea that I&#8217;m trying to
belittle true religion. I think it&#8217;s the greatest
thing by far in the world or accessible to the
world today.</p>

<p>This little digression about something besides
the battle, I suppose, is the result of a habit I
got into in the front lines of thinking when
things were unusually dangerous and there was
nothing to do but let it work for the time being,
of something pleasant and wholly unassociated
with the nasty business in hand.</p>

<p>I remember how Lieutenant Stuart, my
Battalion Scout Officer (he was half Indian)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
when we had finished discussing the details of
a patrolling expedition he was going to lead in
a few minutes&mdash;and it took a lot of nerve to
prowl around no-man&#8217;s land in the dead of
night&mdash;would pause, then with a broad smile
and chuckling, a little, would tell me some
trifling story, usually about something that
occurred when he was a small child away back
in Arizona. Then, still grinning and chuckling,
he&#8217;d get up and say: &#8220;Well, Major, it&#8217;s time
to pull out. The boys are waiting. See you as
soon as I get back.&#8221; I never felt right sure
he&#8217;d come back.</p>

<p>My Adjutant, too, when we&#8217;d be waiting for
some terrible thing to happen during the night,
expecting an assault, shells dropping promiscuously
and perhaps a bombing plane buzzing
overhead, used to tell some of the most outlandish
stories of his experiences while a regular in
Hawaii or the Philippines or some place. I
suppose all men exposed to real danger had
some way of &#8220;kidding&#8221; themselves along under
most any conditions. If they didn&#8217;t have they
were in a bad way.</p>

<p>Soon after I was resurrected from the shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
hole a runner from the right front company
(by the way, he was sighted in Division orders
and should have had a medal for the way he
got to me) stumbled in exhausted, with a note
from Green (who, under machine gun fire, had
climbed a tree to get a better view) advising me
that the enemy was preparing in force to rush
our right flank. Two platoons, one from the
support, the other from the Reserve Company,
and my two remaining reserve machine guns
had barely time to reach the spot to which they
were ordered when the assault started. By
flanking our would-be flankers as they came
over a ridge, they saved the day. Several attacks
against our front failed to succeed because
of well directed fire.</p>

<p>And still the bombardment continued without
a pause. It seemed to me that almost all
the big guns that side of Metz were firing on
Bois Frehaut and the old no-man&#8217;s land just
behind it. And I learned afterward that they
were, for we were the only ones that had taken
and were holding any special territory. They
had been expecting a drive on Metz for some
time and their artillery especially was well prepared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Shrapnel and high explosive contact
shells of all sizes fell on all parts of the area.
They knew more about the armistice than we
did and his artillery seemed to want to do all
the damage it could while the war lasted. Just
before dark on the tenth he began throwing
over great quantities of gas and continued to
mix it in all night long. They seemed determined
to run us out or exterminate us.</p>

<p>For twenty-eight long hours we advanced
and <i>held</i> under a bombardment that in my
opinion had not been surpassed if equalled on
a similar area held by American troops during
a similar length of time. The enemy had
allowed the Allies some time before to get as
close to Metz as he intended they should get&mdash;that
was the outside wire of Bois Frehaut. We
were not attacking in great force after hours
of artillery preparation with almost innumerable
big guns supporting us, though what artillery
was in action behind us did excellent work.
Neither was the enemy fighting a rear guard
action while his main forces beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>At ten o&#8217;clock the night of the tenth I received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
a copy of orders indicating that a battalion
was to enter the western part of the
wood during the night and advance on the enemy
through my left front company, &#8220;G,&#8221; at
five o&#8217;clock next morning. I smiled in my gas
mask, for I had watched the efforts of a certain
battalion backed by another battalion, to come
up into the woods during the afternoon. They
got as far as Ferme de Belle Aire&mdash;part of
them&mdash;and at dark withdrew. Very early the
morning of the eleventh the &#8220;attacking&#8221; battalion
got within the outer wire of Bois Frehaut.
By five A. M. two officers and a handful
of men had worked their way as far as the
headquarters of a certain &#8220;G&#8221; Company
platoon. Our barrage started on the dot. The
two officers, followed by the handful of men,
advanced beyond our front line and looked
about. One of the officers was promptly
wounded, and&mdash;well there was no attack.</p>

<p>During that entire twenty-eight hours Signal
Outfits from Division Headquarters were
trying to get a telephone line up to my P. C.
But the wire was always either shot in two or
the men were and I had no &#8217;phone until after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the armistice. It was almost impossible for
runners to get between me and our old front
lines behind us, and still more difficult for my
runners to get between me and my own Company
and Platoon leaders in the woods. But
they did it.</p>

<p>All day, all night and up to eleven o&#8217;clock
next morning it lasted. By midnight the entire
wood fairly reeked with gas. No one dared eat
or drink because of it. Despite all our precautions
and efforts, we were rapidly being wiped
out. I have heard of officers and of men and
of units&mdash;large ones and small ones, white and
also colored, that became panic stricken and
useless under fire that was feeble and light both
in intensity and duration compared to this,
but I am ready at any time to testify that
twelve hundred and fifty officers and men
(colored) <i>did</i> advance and that the command
did hold <i>without showing the faintest symptoms
of panic or retreat</i>.</p>

<p>All of you who were with the Three Hundred
and Sixty-fifth Infantry prior to September
twenty-third, 1918, know Colonel Vernon A.
Caldwell of West Point and the Regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Army. He organized and commanded the
Regiment until he was made a Brigadier General
and left us on the date named. To him I
attribute much of the credit for our success
in taking and holding Bois Frehaut. He had
taught us &#8220;simple and direct means and methods&#8221;
and had taught us to &#8220;think tactics&#8221; in a
way that proved of inestimable value under the
supreme test. For Colonel Caldwell was one
of our professional officers who did not have
to pose as a &#8220;disciplinarian&#8221; to get by.</p>

<p>You might like to know about that action
from the standpoint of tactics and how it was
that many of us survived without permanent
injury. It is very interesting. I wish I might
explain it in detail. To me it is more interesting
from the standpoint of courage, efficiency
and unswerving devotion to duty displayed by
both officers and men. It was a fitting climax
to an enviable battalion record of front line
service, and an accomplishment most creditable
to the American Army and to its colored soldiers.</p>

<p>I wish I had time to tell you of the many
especially glorious deeds of heroism performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
by officers and men. I use the word <i>glorious</i>,
for to me, even that is a weak word to use in
describing the heroic actions of a man utterly
and deliberately, premeditatedly indifferent to
his personal safety and bent solely on duty
plus a desire to help and save others. And
to me, too, that is the only thing about war,
unless it is the fortitude of those left at home
in suspense and unselfishly doing all in their
power to help, that comes any way near being
<i>glorious</i>.</p>

<p>If they&#8217;d only kill them outright instead of
leaving them to suffer and die in agony perhaps
hours (even months) later. To see them
suffering and be powerless to help them, and to
know that many might be saved if it were possible
to stop the slaughter long enough to give
them proper medical attention. Many men
died in Bois Frehaut or afterward who might
have been saved, could they have been promptly
and properly attended. What a hell of a game
for <i>Christian</i> nations to be playing and getting
ready to play again, in the Twentieth Century
A. D.</p>

<p>One little scene has bobbed up in my memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&mdash;the
death of an &#8220;E&#8221; Company Runner. Late
on the afternoon of the tenth I left my P. C.
to get a view of a certain position. I had gone
but a short distance when I stepped on something
that attracted by attention. It was a
human hand! Near it was a large spot of blood
and a trail as though something had been
dragged in the general direction of where our
First Aid Dressing Station had been before
it was blown up. My course lay a little to the
right, but I followed the gruesome marks for
about fifty yards and there huddled up in a little
gulley laid the &#8220;E&#8221; Company Runner I
had sent out with a message for Captain Sanders
about two hours before.</p>

<p>Not only was his right arm off at the elbow,
but his right side and leg were badly mangled.
I thought he was dead, but bent over and put
my hand on his forehead. His eyes opened.
In them was a wistful, faraway look. I spoke,
and with an apparent effort he got them focused,
they brightened with recognition, and
immediately, almost to my undoing, his body
straightened! His right shoulder and the
stub of an arm jerked! Utterly helpless,
trembling on the very brink of eternity, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
had come to &#8220;Attention&#8221; and had <i>saluted</i> his
Major!</p>

<p>Then I noticed he was making a pitiful effort
to talk, and in some way, I can&#8217;t explain just
how, I got the impression that there was something
in his pocket he wished to see. I took out
a wallet and found what I knew he wanted. It
was a post-card photo of a pretty colored girl
holding in her arms a dark, smiling baby. Shells
were screeching over. Just then one tore the
earth nearby and sprinkled us with dirt. I
propped his head against my knee and held the
picture close to his eyes. A proud, satisfied
look came into them, then a calm, tired smile.
He seemed looking farther and farther away.
Another terrific, bouncing jar and the bloody,
mud smeared form relaxed. Another brave
comrade had &#8220;gone west.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little farther on I saw a big private leaning
against the splintered trunk of a tree, his
bowels all hanging out. No one else was near.
He seemed to be in delirium and was crying
pitifully like a little child for &#8220;Mamma.&#8221; When
he saw me he stared for an instant, then jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
up and yelled, &#8220;Major Ross is with us! Go to
it, boys!&#8221; and fell over&mdash;dead. Then I thought
about all I had heard to the effect that you have
to treat soldiers like dogs&mdash;especially colored
ones&mdash;to gain discipline and inspire respect.
I thanked God I didn&#8217;t have to.</p>

<p>I might tell you how that morning during
the advance, I happened to be looking at a
non-com. section leader a little way to my left
when there was a wicked crack and a blinding
flash just above and in front of him, and how
I saw his headless body&mdash;the blood gushing&mdash;actually
step and lunge forward against a rock.
I could tell you about strong men who went
raving mad (and were still insane when I last
heard) in that horrible turmoil. I could tell for
hours about awful things in Bois Frehaut&mdash;let
alone previous experiences in other places&mdash;the
days were bad but the long weird nights. They
are too gruesome, too sickening to talk about
long at a time even here where we&#8217;re all safe,
rested and well. No wonder the men who actually,
personally underwent such suffering won&#8217;t
talk about it much. But the memory of those
awful things, pass it off as they may, is seared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
deep into their very souls and will haunt them
at times until their dying day.</p>

<p>There were people in America and also in
France who wore officers&#8217; uniforms and had
the time of their lives and there were some who,
if there is justice to come, will surely pay for
their ridiculous arrogance during and following
the war. Militarism is one of the disgusting
institutions I fought to help eliminate. Yes,
it will be eliminated&mdash;and prevented. At a
glance just now on the surface, in most nations,
things look much as before. The same old
gang is in control, but lying and allying, brow
beating, scheming a little more than was necessary
heretofore. Since the World War (the
result of worldly success and money worship)
started in 1914, things have happened. For
instance, the acceleration of the change in woman&#8217;s
status. Votes are merely a result of that
change. This phase alone, and what goes with
it&mdash;the new state of sex affairs&mdash;<i>necessitates</i>
and will help bring about a changing of human
viewpoint.</p>

<p>Whether or not certain persons and classes
of persons like it, Democracy is in the world to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
stay, and staying will increase and flourish as
the people learn. Reversion for the masses to
ignorance, feudalism, slavery is unthinkable&mdash;impossible.
Is the Almighty God a human
fool? Has humanity ever or will it ever get
away with the assumption that He is? Think
of those fine young victims I mentioned lying
in and hanging on the wire in front of Belle
Aire Farm.</p>

<p>More important than militarism and war, or
than politics, or than how to acquire fortunes,
or than anything else is the learning&mdash;not just
about it&mdash;but <i>how to attain</i> righteousness,
peace, contentment, true happiness. I put
righteousness first for there&#8217;ll be none of those
things humanity longs for without it. There&#8217;ll
be plenty of hypocrisy, but not much genuine
righteousness until more of us get our minds,
our hearts, our aspirations set on something
higher than materialism and worldliness. You
can not <i>legislate</i> righteousness into the hearts
of humanity.</p>

<p>A host of thinking people are beginning to
suspicion this to such an extent that they are
interested in finding out the truth&mdash;the <i>remedy</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Now there are persons rushing about, others
lying in wait to tell you the &#8220;truth.&#8221; Or they
will hand you a pamphlet or sell you a book or
refer you to one written by some person who
makes great claims or insinuations about having
&#8220;inside information.&#8221; There may be enough
truth to it to fool the thoughtless or credulous
and it may be insidious enough to worry even
the wise. There are several that make startling
claims, but none have <i>yet</i> overcome any material
laws. There are numerous courses of study
and &#8220;systems,&#8221; not claiming to be Christian or
religious, that guarantee to, and no doubt do,
help you in business, add to your success, cure
your ailments&mdash;some of them&mdash;and benefit your
health.</p>

<p>Almost innumerable panaceas for all ills
are advanced. Some of those religionists and
uplifters with the &#8220;inside information&#8221; and
&#8220;special revelations,&#8221; etc., may be sincere and
many people may believe whatever it is. The
same is true of the Turks and the South Sea
Island Head-Hunters.</p>

<p>But in so far as I can find out there never
lived on this earth but <i>one Man</i> who taught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
things we need to and want to know about&mdash;who
absolutely lived up to them Himself and
who proved them and demonstrated them beyond
all peradventure. You will find by honest,
careful study, experiment and thought that
these things and these alone are <i>practical</i>. That
Man was born in a stable, died on a cross and
left an estate consisting of the clothes He wore.
He&#8217;s the man who said, &#8220;Love your enemies.&#8221;
&#8220;Lay up your treasures in Heaven.&#8221; &#8220;My
Kingdom is not of this world.&#8221; &#8220;If you love me,
keep my commandments or sayings.&#8221; &#8220;Except
a man be born again....&#8221; &#8220;By their fruits
shall ye know them,&#8221; etc., etc. And He&#8217;s the
One Christendom claims to follow.</p>

<p>Fortunately certain men who knew Him
personally and others who knew His Apostles
personally wrote about Him&mdash;what He said
and what He <i>did</i>. Some of those writings were
gotten together and compiled into a book.
That book is called &#8220;The New Testament.&#8221;
Now with all due respect and consideration for
the motives and intentions of many of those
who have since written, some of whom claim or
infer &#8220;special&#8221; or &#8220;inside&#8221; information, I humbly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
suggest that the logical, safe, reliable place
for each of us to learn about Christ is in the
New Testament. Let&#8217;s find out whether He
really said anything applicable and worth while
<i>now</i>, whether He meant it, whether He lived it
and proved it, and, above all, let us stick to it
until we find out <i>what it was and is</i>. The world
needs it badly&mdash;needs it pure and undiluted,
unadulterated&mdash;needs to know what it is without
concessions and without reservations. If
the people are smart enough to govern themselves
(and I think they are and that they&#8217;re
improving in that ability right along) they are
now at last smart enough to study the New
Testament itself by themselves and for themselves.
How can any Christian logically object
to that?</p>

<p>The only solution for humanity&#8217;s problems
and difficulties lies in a <i>correct</i> understanding
of the teachings of Christ&mdash;not some vanity
tickling subterfuge. Some persons think they
know all about it now. No human is raising
the dead or stilling the tempest these days and
that &#8220;know it all&#8221; attitude is the result of fleshly
vanity&mdash;not knowledge. So let&#8217;s start or review,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
beginning in the primary grade or the
kindergarten. Many seem to have started in
the post-graduate courses or at least in the
senior class. I have a suspicion that selfishness,
vanity, swell headedness, worldly pride, material
ambition (whether called material or not),
and so on, are the direct opposite to Christianity.</p>

<p>I thought I knew a lot about religion, but
after they led me out of Bois Frehaut I started
in in the primary grade to try to learn about
Christianity&mdash;so to speak. The world must
learn <i>what it is</i>, then begin learning to apply it
or live it. It will be done. The churches will
help. They&#8217;ll help or quit. Many of them
are about through now. But Christianity as
Christ taught it won&#8217;t quit. It will soon be the
paramount subject of conversation and consideration.
The world has reached a stage of material
advancement. The people are awake,
enlightened and organized to such an extent
that things will become unbearable&mdash;impossible
without it.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t very well leave out all mention of
Christianity in this lecture, for the things my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Battalion fought to help make possible and
to bring about in the world are in one sense
closely allied to Christianity. There couldn&#8217;t
be much real Christianity without Democracy
and there can&#8217;t be any real Democracy without
Christianity. I don&#8217;t claim to be much of a
Christian, but I wish I had time to tell you
what I think it is, and why I think so and what
<i>makes</i> me think so, and so on. You look into it
yourselves. And now we must get out of Bois
Frehaut.</p>

<p>Not until ten-thirty o&#8217;clock on the morning
of November eleventh did I receive orders relative
to an armistice. The third runner sent out
got through to me with a Division order. I was
in direct command of the principal advancing
done in attempts on the tenth and eleventh
toward Metz and this was the first definite word
I had about the armistice. We had heard that
such a thing was expected but I supposed it
would be several days, maybe weeks, before it
went into effect. We knew that German officers
had gone through the lines under a flag of
truce to meet representatives of the High
Allied Command, but we did not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
what the result of those parleys had been.
Some thought hostilities would not cease for
months.</p>

<p>Therefore, imagine our joy in that unbearable
shellhole, when we found the war had but
<i>thirty minutes</i> to last. Of those with me at the
time some shouted for happiness and some
stared in amazement fearing it was too good to
be true. I sent the word out to my leaders and
sat looking at my watch. Artillery fire increased
in intensity if any difference and enemy
machine gunners elevated their pieces and
were spraying the wood with bullets. It would
have been hard luck to get hit then. Promptly
at eleven o&#8217;clock all fire began to lessen and in
a few minutes had ceased. The World War
had stopped.</p>

<p>Not only our men but the Germans also
seemed overjoyed. Soon after the buglers had
sounded &#8220;cease firing&#8221; the Huns rushed out
of their positions and our men met them between
the lines. They actually shook hands and
slapped each others&#8217; backs. They traded trinkets
and were holding a veritable reception
until our officers succeeded in getting the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
back into the lines. I wouldn&#8217;t believe it if I
hadn&#8217;t seen it.</p>

<p>During the afternoon I received word that
our Lieutenant-Colonel, commanding the Regiment,
together with some members of his staff,
had been badly gassed in a dugout at Regimental
Headquarters and forced to go to the
hospital and that I, being next in rank, was
temporarily in command of the Regiment. My
face was so swollen that I could see a little only
with one eye. My ears had been bleeding and
I had to be yelled at to hear. I was scratched
and bruised and my voice refused to work. A
sort of reaction had set in and I felt weak and
sick. We passed a row of dead and pieces of
dead and some more dead and finally reached
the limousine that had been sent for me.</p>

<p>We were proceeding slowly because of shell
holes in the road when one of the men with me
said, &#8220;There&#8217;s a man ahead singing and waving
his arms like he&#8217;s crazy.&#8221; I could see that he
was rared back and singing or yelling and
every few steps he stopped and waved his arms
and executed some strange dance movements.
When we overtook him I stopped the car and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
asked him what was the matter. &#8220;Sir&mdash;Major,&#8221;
he said, his eyes beaming, &#8220;I&mdash;I just can&#8217;t
praise God enough for letting me come out of
that woods alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>The outfit was too tired to move far that day.
But the next morning the regimental band
came to me in a body and asked permission
to march up the road a mile or so to meet the
Second Battalion, which under my orders was
coming to Loisey, where there were comfortable
billets, to rest. I walked out into the village
square, as Regimental Commander, to welcome
my heroic battalion&mdash;the battalion that
had <i>earned</i> undying fame for itself, its regiment,
its brigade, its division and for the American
colored race.</p>

<p>Soon I heard the band playing as it never
played before and they came into view marching
up the main street of the town. There at
the head, limping and dirty, was my big senior
captain, Sanders. Farther back I could recognize
Green, captain of &#8220;H,&#8221; stocky and
ragged, marching abreast of his company
guide. Others I noticed, and the absence of
others, and many thoughts flashed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
my mind as I watched them marching
toward me.</p>

<p>Sanders saw me and knew what to do. I
never gave many fancy orders, it wasn&#8217;t necessary
in that outfit. When the middle of the
column was opposite he bawled in a hoarse
voice&mdash;but they, too, knew what to do&mdash;&#8220;Squads
left&mdash;March! Battalion&mdash;Halt!&#8221;
Those heels clicked. Their rifles, like one piece,
in three clear-cut movements, snapped down to
the &#8220;order.&#8221; Again he yelled, or tried to yell,
&#8220;Present, arms!&#8221; Again two distinct and
snappy movements. Sanders faced about
standing at salute and there before me at &#8220;present
arms&#8221;&mdash;not much larger than one company
should be, stood all that was left of my
wonderful Second Battalion!&mdash;My heroes of
Bois Frehaut!</p>

<p>Note: Many were wholly incapacitated for
many days, whose names were not turned in
in final reports of &#8220;casualties.&#8221;</p>

<p>I brought them to the &#8220;order&#8221; and stood
spell bound. It was by far the most touching,
the most thrilling, the most awe-inspiring ceremony
I ever experienced or witnessed. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
they stood&mdash;covered with mud, stained and
spattered with blood, their clothes, what was
left of them, torn and ripped to shreds. They
looked emaciated&mdash;haggard, but about those
erect, motionless figures, those big steady eyes,
about their whole proud, manly bearing was
something of that true nobility of unselfishness
and sacrifice that is beyond description.</p>

<p>These men had suffered the tortures of the
damned. They had faced all the engines of terror
and destruction that fiendish man could invent.
They had endured the shriek, the smash,
the roar and pandemonium of hell. They had
seen their comrades blown to bits or torn and
mangled, and choked by gas. They had listened,
powerless to help, through long, ghastly
hours, to the pitiful, heart-breaking moans of
the wounded and dying.</p>

<p>Yes, they had been tried, they had been
tested, they had been weighed in the balance,
they had been through a fiery crucible&mdash;and
they were true gold. For many hard, long,
weary weeks they had suffered and endured,
and all for what they believed to be the preservation
of our country, the advancement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Democracy and the betterment of mankind.
I stood there looking, thinking&mdash;torn and
choked by emotion&mdash;thrilled with admiration,
and a feeling rapidly growing that I would
make my soldiers a speech&mdash;an oration. But
<i>what</i> could I say? How could I say it? What
could anyone in my place <i>say</i>? After several
attempts I moved closer and whispered as
loudly as I could, &#8220;Officers and men, your
Major is proud of his Battalion!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX</h2></div>


<p>History will concern itself as nearly as possible
with <i>facts</i>. Relative to the World War
the world believes and will believe what is stated
by those who were in supreme authority and by
those whose business it is dispassionately&mdash;mercilessly
to ascertain and state the truth.
Statements or accounts to the contrary, or that
do not coincide, are merely ridiculous and can
not stand.</p>

<p>Commonplace, every-day occurrences, occurrences
that had no unusual bearing on anything
of special importance, occurrences that were not
exceptional, feats that were not particularly
noteworthy from the standpoint of things as a
whole, attempts that were not successful or were
only partly successful&mdash;or if they cannot be
logically and adequately proved&mdash;no matter
how tremendous and how commendable they
may be and may seem to those directly concerned&mdash;do
not interest or convince very many,
certainly not the general public&mdash;even now,
and, of course, never will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>All accounts of American colored soldiers in
France lay much stress on the Ninety-second
Division&#8217;s attack, just preceding the armistice,
on the defenses of Metz&mdash;conceded to be the
most impregnable inland fortress or position in
the world. To attack the world&#8217;s strongest
fortress <i>means</i> something, and if you attain
any actual, clear cut, unquestionable success,
and if the world knows about it, it means a
great deal. Especially in a Democracy is public
opinion of importance.</p>

<p>At the time this attack was launched, namely,
the morning of November 10th, 1918, the Division
had had sufficient experience in the line
and was sufficiently well organized and
equipped to be taken seriously as a combat Division.
But, unfortunately, our activities
against the defenses and under the guns of
Metz, coming, as they did, immediately preceding
the cessation of hostilities, a time when
so much of interest and importance was transpiring,
received little if any general publicity.</p>

<p>But, imagine my state of mind, having made
a lecture to two colored audiences and having
told my white friends about the wonderful accomplishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of my Colored Battalion, when
I read an Associated Press article sent out from
Washington which contained a paragraph in a
letter credited to General John J. Pershing,
which read as follows: &#8220;The Ninety-second Division,
astride the Moselle, attacked at 7 a. m.,
November 10th and at 5 a. m., November 11th,
advanced a short distance, but the troops had
retired to cover in the face of repeated heavy
fire when the commander of the attacking Brigade
received information at 7:18 a. m. that
an armistice would be effective....&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>My friends or any one&#8217;s friends reading or
hearing of this statement credited to the Commander-in-chief
of the American Expeditionary
Forces would believe that the colored soldiers
of the Ninety-second Division (the only
complete colored combat division) had <i>attempted</i>
something against the fortifications
of Metz but that they had <i>FAILED</i>!</p>

<p>It made Bois Frehaut a hoax. It made me
a liar. It made any colored citizen a laughing
stock who spoke of the great deeds and <i>accomplishments</i>
of colored soldiers under the guns
of Metz.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Generalizations, even if authentic, are not
<i>convincing</i>. Sweeping summaries about units
differently engaged at different times and
places change few opinions. Something specific,
complete in itself, <i>satisfactorily provable
to the skeptical</i> must be shown, so it seemed
up to me to secure and to preserve for the
American colored soldier and for the American
Negro, the credit for a most exceptional and
glorious <i>achievement</i>. Immediately I wrote to
a member of Congress, Hon. Will R. Wood,
sent the extract from the Indianapolis Sunday
Star of January 11th, 1920, and also the facts
about the Ninety-second Division&#8217;s drive toward
Metz.</p>

<p>After General Pershing had returned to
Washington, following his tour of inspection,
and had had the records fully looked into he
wrote a letter to Mr. Wood dated March 1st,
1920. Mr. Wood sent the letter to me. General
Pershing said that the paragraph as published
was incorrect&mdash;that what he actually
said in his letter was: &#8220;The Ninety-second
Division, astride the Moselle attacked at 7 a. m.,
November 10th, and at 5 a. m., November 11th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
renewed the attack. The renewed attack
started at 5 a. m., November 11th advanced a
short distance, but the troops had retired to
cover in the face of reported heavy fire....&#8221;
etc.</p>

<p>Even this statement, while perfectly true as
to the attempts to advance on November 11th,
gives a general impression of failure on the
part of the Division in its advance toward
Metz. It does not, however, make it impossible
or untrue that the key position, Bois Frehaut,
was captured in its entirety on the 10th and
<i>continuously held</i> until the armistice went into
effect. The holding was really of more importance
than the capturing. The orders were
&#8220;capture and hold&#8221; and great emphasis was
laid on the &#8220;hold.&#8221; But General Pershing
goes on most fully and justly, as you will note,
to state and show that the Second Battalion of
the Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth Infantry
did <i>take</i> and did <i>hold</i> the Bois Frehaut, and
that <i>this Battalion fully accomplished</i> its mission.</p>

<p>The General&#8217;s letter was published as part
of an article, under the heading, &#8220;Pershing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Sends Correct Report,&#8221; in the Indianapolis
Star of March 9th, 1920. It was also copied in
other papers. The letter in full follows:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">American Expeditionary Forces</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Office of the Commander-in-Chief</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
March 1, 1920.</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Wood:</p>

<p>I regret that my absence from Washington
has delayed this reply to your letter of January
17th enclosing a letter of January 12th
from Major Ross.</p>

<p>Major Ross quotes a paragraph from a letter
written by me as published in the &#8220;Indianapolis
Star&#8221; and objects to this paragraph as unjust
in so far as his battalion (2nd Battalion,
365th Infantry) is concerned. As quoted by
Major Ross the paragraph to which he objects
reads as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;The 92nd Division, astride the Moselle, attacked
at 7 a. m., November 10th and at 5 a. m.,
November 11th, advanced a short distance, but
the troops had retired to cover in the face of
repeated heavy fire when the commander of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
attacking Brigade received information at 7:18
a. m. that an armistice would be effective at
11 a. m. The Brigade Commander reports that
he ordered all firing stopped by 10:45 a. m. and
that the firing was so stopped.&#8221;</p>

<p>The above quotation is incorrect. The paragraph
as actually written in my letter of November
21st was as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;The 92nd Division, astride the Moselle, attacked
at 7 a. m., November 10th and at 5 a. m.,
November 11th, renewed the attack. The renewed
attack started at 5 a. m., November 11th,
advanced a short distance, but the troops had
retired to cover in the face of reported heavy
fire when the commander of the attacking Brigade
received information at 7:18 a. m. that
an armistice would be effective at 11 a. m. The
Brigade Commander reports that he ordered
all firing stopped by 10:45 a. m. and that the
firing was so stopped.&#8221;</p>

<p>You will note that in the correct paragraph
the reference to the retirement of troops relates
solely to the <i>renewed</i> attack started at 5 a. m.,
November 11th and does not concern the attack
of November 10th. I think a careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
examination of Major Ross&#8217;s letter shows that
his statements as to the work of his battalion
do not assert that any advance was made by
the 2nd Battalion on November 11th. Examination
of the records shows that the 2nd Battalion
did take the Bois Frehaut on November
10th and that this battalion held this position
until the armistice went into effect.</p>

<p>The orders issued by the 183rd Brigade on
the evening of November 10th for the operation
of November 11th contemplated putting the
1st Battalion of the 365th into position in the
western part of Bois Frehaut and&mdash;&#8220;the 2nd
Battalion, 365th Infantry will be held in support
in its present position in the Bois Frehaut.&#8221;
This clearly shows that the 2nd Battalion,
365th Infantry, was not expected to attack
on November 11th; and taken with other
evidence shows that the 2nd Battalion, 365th
Infantry, held, on November 11th, the positions
which it had gained on November 10th.</p>

<p>The actual statements made by me in my
letter of November 21st were correct, based
on the reports of the several commanders, and
I think that Major Ross will agree that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
is nothing in what I have said that reflects in
any way upon the work of the 2nd Battalion,
365th Infantry. That battalion appears to
have done what was expected of it on November
10th and on November 11th. As shown in
the quotation I have given above from the order
issued November 10th for the operation of November
11th, the 2nd Battalion was in support
and was not in the attacking line on the morning
of November 11th.</p>

<p>I am enclosing herewith the papers enclosed
with your letter of January 17th.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gapright">Very sincerely,</span><br />

<p>In view of the general opinion prevailing
among American forces in France, and the impression
of the American public at large relative
to the Ninety-second Division&#8217;s drive toward
Metz also relative to its experience in the
Argonne as represented by the Three Hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and Sixty-eighth Infantry in the attacking line,
it seemed to me advisable to state what the
result was of work done by attacking units,
other than the Second Battalion of the Three
Hundred and Sixty-fifth Infantry, in the advance
on Metz fortifications on November 10th
and 11th. It is especially well that I mentioned
them since General Pershing says in effect (and
the General knows and is regarded as an authority)
that the Second Battalion, Three
Hundred and Sixty-fifth Infantry <i>fully accomplished</i>
its mission, and also that attacks made
on the 11th &#8220;advanced a short distance, but
had retired to cover....&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt, before reading my lecture, <i>some</i>
were of the opinion that the Ninety-second Division
was rushing with irresistible force past
and over strong points, regardless of all defenses,
sweeping all before it and was only prevented
from battering down the walls of the
city of Metz itself by the armistice. As nearly
every soldier, from General Pershing down,
knows and as the final battle line as compared
with the line on November 9th clearly proves,
such was not the case. Had I indulged in glittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
generalities to that effect, had I even inferred
it, or had I left an impression that all
units concerned, accomplished their missions,
that is, succeeded in carrying out their orders,
I would lay myself open to serious and just
criticism, for as leader of the attack on the key
position, which was the central position, it was
my business to <i>know</i> what happened on my
front and on my flanks. I would be considered
untruthful or at least an exaggerator, and all
that I have said, if it has any effect at all, would
detract from rather than add to the credit due
the American colored soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scott&#8217;s Official History of the American
Negro in the World War,&#8221; written and compiled
by Emmett J. Scott, special assistant to
the Secretary of War, contains the general reports,
less appendices and details, of the Commander
of the Ninety-second Division and of
the Commander of the One Hundred and
Eighty-third Brigade relative to operations of
November 10th and 11th. For your convenience
I shall cite pages in Dr. Scott&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>I said something to the effect that the battalion
of the white division on the left of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
367th&#8217;s front attacked, lost about 156 men in
a few minutes and retired. I also said that the
367th Infantry on our left&mdash;just across the
Moselle failed to accomplish its mission.</p>

<p>Page 151, Brigade Report, &#8220;At 10:30 a. m.
a message from the Division was received that
the attack of the 367th Infantry, 184th Brigade
had been repulsed (on our left), but that
two companies were being sent forward to reinforce
their attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Page 159, Division Report, &#8220;10 Nov. 9:30 hr.&mdash;Attack
by 367th Infantry west of Moselle
not prosecuted because of failure of 56th Infantry,
7th Division, to capture Preny. The
report of the C. O., 367th Infantry at pages
2 and 3 shows the facts and reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Page 160, Division report, &#8220;Inasmuch as the
367th Infantry west of the Moselle made no
advance due to the fact that it was necessary
that the 7th Division should first capture Preny
before an advance was practicable, no report is
made here of enemy units engaged west of the
Moselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>That, I take it, is enough to prove that no
success was achieved by units advancing or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
advance on our left. It is necessary to prove
<i>that</i> for the benefit of only a very few, for the
overwhelming majority of Americans (owing
to the effort to give all units equal credit and
imply that all concerned succeeded) are ignorant,
or seriously in doubt whether the 92nd Division
or any of its units achieved any real success
<i>anywhere</i>.</p>

<p>Now let us see about our brigade&mdash;the 183rd,
which comprised the 365th and 366th infantry
and the 350th Machine Gun Battalion. The
Brigade report says, latter part of paragraph
2 on page 149, same book, &#8220;The object of this
attack was to capture and hold the Boise Frehaut
and the Bois Voivrotte (Bois Voivrotte is
the name of the small wood I spoke of in the
lecture, to our right) with the object of advancing
the line of observation of the Marbache
sector to the northern boundary of these
woods.&#8221; So our brigade orders were to capture
and hold these two woods, and, as we were advancing
from the south, the line we were to
hold respectively, was the <i>northern boundary</i>
of both these woods.</p>

<p>Page 149, paragraph 3 of Brigade report:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
&#8220;The attack was to be made on the Bois Frehaut
by the 2nd Bn. 365th Inf., Major Warner
A. Ross, commanding. The attack on the Bois
Voivrotte was to be made by two platoons, 2nd
Bn. 366th Inf. At the zero,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>At the early hour of 8:12, the report says,
page 150, a message had been relayed from Division
headquarters to Brigade headquarters
to the effect that Bois Voivrotte was completely
occupied. It was very small compared to the
positions the 2nd Bn. 365th Inf. was attacking.
And the next entry, as given on page 150, is:
&#8220;At 9 a. m. a message was received that sharp
fighting by machine guns was going on in the
Bois Voivrotte and the Bois Frehaut.&#8221; This
was the case in Bois Frehaut at that time and
at 8:30 when I sent that particular message
relative to Bois Frehaut by pigeon. Now, the
fact that machine gun fighting was going on in
Bois Voivrotte means that either the 8:12 message
about it being completely occupied was
premature or that machine guns had been sent
in by the enemy after the platoons of the 2nd
Bn. 366th Inf. &#8220;completely occupied&#8221; it. For
if enemy machine gunners were occupying and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fighting in the wood it could not be said to be
&#8220;completely occupied&#8221; by our troops.</p>

<p>After the 2nd Battalion, 365th Infantry had
completely occupied Bois Frehaut and established
our line along the northern boundary and
also the eastern boundary of that wood (it was
much farther north than the northern boundary
of Bois Voivrotte) it became impracticable for
the enemy to send or keep troops in Bois Voivrotte
unless he drove my Battalion from Bois
Frehaut. He was still at liberty, however, to
rain artillery fire upon it. But here it is officially
from the commander of the 2nd Bn. 366th Inf.
On page 151, Brigade report: &#8220;3:05 p. m.
Telephone message from C. O. 2nd Bn. 366th
Inf. that he had withdrawn his lines to southern
edge of Bois Voivrotte because of heavy enemy
shelling&mdash;high explosives and gas in woods.&#8221;
This final cessation of their efforts to hold Bois
Voivrotte and withdrawal of their lines to the
<i>southern</i> edge of it was <i>one</i> reason for the next
entry on same page: &#8220;3:55 p. m. Orders received
from Commanding General 92nd Division
not to launch attack as planned for 5 p. m.,
but to consolidate positions gained, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
them at all costs against possible counter attacks.&#8221;
For how could the other units that
were supposed to attack through the units supposed
to be holding Bois Voivrotte advance beyond
its northern boundary when as a matter
of fact according to the Battalion C. O.&mdash;directly
in command&mdash;they were only <i>holding</i> the
<i>southern</i> boundary. Obviously it was necessary
to <i>recapture</i> Bois Voivrotte and <i>hold</i> it&mdash;all of
it, before they could consider capturing anything
beyond, or north of it.</p>

<p>The <i>other</i> reason for the calling off by the
Division Commander of the attack scheduled to
be launched from the northern boundaries of
Bois Frehaut and Bois Voivrotte at 5 p. m.,
on the 10th, was equally obvious. For how
could the units scheduled to attack through the
2nd Battalion of the 365th then holding the
<i>northern</i> boundary of Bois Frehaut, be expected
to advance <i>beyond</i> us when they had
never succeeded, due to enemy artillery fire, in
reaching even the <i>southern</i> boundary of Bois
Frehaut.</p>

<p>At the time when the attack <i>beyond</i> Bois
Voivrotte was almost due to be launched by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
other units of the 366th they were <i>not holding</i>
Bois Voivrotte but had withdrawn their line to
the southern edge and were holding what previously
had been no-man&#8217;s land&mdash;very much
narrower there than in front of Ferme de Belle
Aire. As can readily be seen, this failure to
hold, on their part, left me in a precarious
condition should the enemy in force attempt to
envelop us through Bois Voivrotte. This was
largely the cause for the order to the artillery
mentioned in the Division Report, page 160:
&#8220;11 Nov. 3:59&mdash;Artillery directed to put down
barrage on northern edge of Bois Voivrotte,
this point not being occupied by our troops.&#8221;
I think, bearing in mind General Pershing&#8217;s
brief remarks relative to attacks on the 11th
of November, that this covers them all, including
troops of the 7th Division attacking
through the C. R. adjoining the 367th on the
left.</p>

<p>What does all this mean? It means that of
all the battalions concerned or engaged in attacking
toward Metz during the drive that
started the morning of November 10th, the only
battalion that accomplished its mission, or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
other words, the only one that was able to carry
out its orders&mdash;the only one that captured and
held anything, was the 2nd Battalion of the
365th Infantry. Had this battalion <i>not</i> succeeded
in capturing and holding Bois Frehaut,
in fact had it not succeeded in all of its various
missions at all times, and had its companies,
as companies, not succeeded in all their various
missions, I would not be publishing any book
about it at all, let alone praising the battalion as
I have.</p>

<p>But let us see some more quotations from
things included in Dr. Scott&#8217;s History. Ralph
W. Tyler, the colored war correspondent, writing,
necessarily from hearsay mostly, at a time
when the confusion and din of battle made it
impossible to foresee results, could, however,
see the landscape in general and he knew who
was attacking and later who was holding Bois
Frehaut. He also visited Bois Frehaut after
the armistice, so among other things he wrote,
page 289: &#8220;... and so the 2nd Battalion went
into action with but one white officer, the Major.
No unit in the advance had a more difficult
position to take and hold than the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
assigned to the 2nd Battalion of the 365th.
The Bois Frehaut was a network of barbed-wire
entanglements, and the big guns in Metz
had nothing to do but sweep the woods with a
murderous fire, which they did most effectively.
French and Senegalese in turn had failed to
hold these woods, for it was worse than a hell&mdash;it
had become the sepulchre of hundreds. I
(Ralph W. Tyler) was over and through these
woods; I saw the mass of barbed-wire entanglements;
I saw the nests in the trees
in which Germans had camouflaged machine
guns that rained a fire upon the Allied
troops.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible to describe this scene of carnage.
The order to the colored men of the
365th was to &#8216;take and hold&#8217; although it was
believed, almost to a certainty, that they could
not hold it, even if they did take it. But they
did take and hold it, and these men of the 2nd
Battalion, with Spartan-like courage; with an
endurance unbelievable, would be holding the
position at this writing had not the armistice
been signed or had they not received orders to
retire.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>He also says that &#8220;the Major commanding
stated to me that the world had never produced
gamer fighters than the colored men who made
up his battalion of the 365th infantry.&#8221; But
his next three paragraphs as quoted in &#8220;Scott&#8217;s
History&#8221; are mostly erroneous as to previous
conditions. The records will show (the necessary
records are not in that book), but every
one who was in the 365th Infantry and most
every one in the Division knows that the 2nd
Bn. 365th held the front line battalion sector
east of the Moselle called C. R. Musson <i>continuously</i>
for thirty-one days, then went back,
occupied the second line of defense for three
days (during which time various units marched
up and engaged the enemy to ascertain his
strength), returned to Pont-a-Mousson on the
9th and attacked on the morning of the 10th.
During this time the 1st and 3rd Battalions
took turns holding the C. R. on our right&mdash;C.
R. Les Menils. I had not read Dr. Scott&#8217;s
book at the time I made my lecture. During
the Division&#8217;s occupancy of the St. Die sector
this battalion held a front line sector continuously.
In the Argonne it did road work as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
close to the advanced line as any of the battalions.
The Division was praised by General
Pershing for its work in facilitating traffic
during the Argonne Meuse drive, that is, the
early part of that drive. Elements of the 368th
Infantry were in the attacking line for a short
time. Early in October the entire Division was
moved out of the Argonne-Meuse section and
to the Marbache sector. No battalion of the
368th Infantry ever held a front line position
in the Marbache sector.</p>

<p>To show you how Mr. Tyler was impressed
with Bois Frehaut I will quote from his writings
again. Page 286, Dr. Scott&#8217;s book: &#8220;The
armistice stopped their advance into Berlin, but
they did reach the nearest point to the German
city of Metz in what was designed as a victorious
march to Berlin, and the valor they displayed,
their courageous, heroic fighting all
along that advance, won for our men in the
92nd Division high praise from superior officers,
including the corps and division commanders,
for they never wavered an instant,
not even in that awful hell, the Frehaut Woods,
upon which the big guns of Metz constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
played, which the Senegalese were unable to
hold, but which our colored soldiers from America
did take and did hold, until the signal came
announcing the cessation of hostilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shall now give a few more extracts from
the Brigade Commander&#8217;s report. On page
150, same book: &#8220;At 10 a. m. (Nov. 10th) a
runner message was received from the Commanding
Officer, 2nd Bn., 365th Inf., to the
effect that they were being heavily shelled in
the Bois Frehaut by enemy artillery, and requesting
counter battery fire; it was also stated
that their advance had almost reached the
northern edge of Bois Frehaut. Heavy artillery
was asked to counter-fire on enemy artillery,
which they promptly did.&#8221; I sent this
message about 9 o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>On page 151, Brigade report: &#8220;At 11:15
a. m. a message from the C. O. 2nd Bn. 365th
Inf. to the effect that Bois Frehaut was completely
occupied, that Boches were shelling
woods with gas and high explosives, and requesting
counter battery fire.&#8221; This was the
message spoken of in the lecture that I sent
at 10 o&#8217;clock by pigeon to Division Headquarters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
It was read there and relayed to
Brigade Headquarters (situated in another
village).</p>

<p>Page 152, Brigade report: &#8220;Our advance
was for a depth of about three and one-half
kilometers. When this Brigade took over the
sector just east of the Moselle river there was a
deep re-entrant next to the river, due to the
St. Mihiel drive which advanced the line several
kilometers on the west bank of the Moselle
river, while the line on the east bank remained
in place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reason it &#8220;remained in place&#8221; was that
neither French, Americans nor Senegalese
troops had succeeded in getting into it (Bois
Frehaut) very far&mdash;let alone taking and holding
it.</p>

<p>Page 153, Brigade report: &#8220;Full use was
made of auxiliary arms, machine guns, 37 millimeter
guns, Stokes mortars and rifle grenades.
All of these weapons, except Stokes mortars
were brought into play in the heavy fighting in
the Bois Frehaut to combat enemy machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
gun nests. 37 mm. guns were pushed well to
the front when direct fire at enemy machine
gun positions could be obtained. It was to the
extensive use of these weapons that the rapid
advance through Bois Frehaut was due. Machine
guns were used frequently to cover the
flanks of the attacking infantry. They aided
materially in protecting the N. E. corner of
the Bois Frehaut from an enemy counter attack
from Bouxires. Trench mortars were placed
in position after the Frehaut woods were taken,
to cover the new front.&#8221;</p>

<p>Page 154, Brigade report: &#8220;The lines held by
the Germans were unusually strong, being the
result of four years of stabilization in that sector.
Their artillery was most active, as unquestionably
during these years they had registered
on every point of importance in the sector.
Furthermore, their positions were the first
line of defense of Metz. The troops occupying
them were young, efficient men and not old
soldiers from a rest sector.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wish to state here that our Division artillery
rendered excellent service. This is especially
true when we consider that it had been in the
line only a few days.</p>

<p>But a very apparent inconsistency appears in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the Brigade report and is embodied in the Division
report, page 161: &#8220;The attack was renewed
on the morning of the 11th, the lines
being advanced to the northern edge of the Bois
Frehaut a distance of three and one-half km.
from an original line.&#8221; The <i>Division</i> report
says, as you notice, that the line was advanced
on the 11th to the northern edge of Bois Frehaut,
the Division commander well knowing
that the line never was advanced beyond the
northern edge of Bois Frehaut, for the next
paragraph refers to the final battle line, which
the co-ordinates show <i>was</i> the northern edge of
Bois Frehaut, but the Brigade report upon
which this part of the Division report is based
by a Division commander who took command
just after the armistice says, page 152: &#8220;The
attack on the morning of Nov. 10, by units of
the Brigade wiped out this re-entrant by advancing
our lines on the east bank of the Moselle
river a distance of two and one-quarter
km. The advance thus made was held against
heavy artillery and machine gun fire and high
concentration of gas. The attack was renewed
on the morning of Nov. 11, lines being advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
a distance of three and one-quarter km. an
original line.&#8221;</p>

<p>That would indicate an advance of one km.
on Nov. 11th. I don&#8217;t care to discuss that further
than to say that it is <i>incorrect</i>. The final
battle line shows as the northern edge of Bois
Frehaut. The Division report says, &#8220;the attack
was renewed on the morning of the 11th
the lines being advanced to the northern edge of
Bois Frehaut, a distance of three and one-half
km. from an original line.&#8221; Since, as clearly
shown, the line was never advanced beyond the
northern edge of Bois Frehaut <i>where</i> was <i>that</i>
advance made? Speaking of this mysterious
advance of the 11th the Brigade report says,
&#8220;Our liaison with troops west of the river was
thereby greatly improved,&#8221; indicating that the
said unexplainable and vague &#8220;advance&#8221; was
near the river&mdash;hence on my front.</p>

<p>General Pershing says that &#8220;examination of
the records shows that the 2nd Battalion did
take the Bois Frehaut on November 10th and
that this battalion held this position until the
armistice went into effect.&#8221; How could he say
that we took the Bois Frehaut on Nov. 10th if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
there was a km. (which is almost a mile) remaining
of it to be taken on Nov. 11th? Of
the advance of the 11th he says, &#8220;advanced a
short distance but <i>had retired</i> to cover.&#8221;</p>

<p>This same Brigade report shows that at 10
a. m., Nov. 10th, a message was received showing
that the 2nd Bn. 365th Inf. had almost
reached the northern edge of Bois Frehaut, and
that at 11:15, Nov. 10th a message was received
showing the Bois Frehaut was <i>completely occupied</i>.
The quotation above from the same report
says that the re-entrant was wiped out by
advancing our lines on the east bank of the Moselle
on November 10th and that the advance
thus made <i>was held</i> against heavy artillery and
machine gun fire, etc. The Brigade order for
the attack on November 11th&mdash;the order from
which Gen. Pershing quoted, plainly shows that
that attack was to be launched from the northern
edge of Bois Frehaut&mdash;our front line.</p>

<p>It is too bad to have to spend time correcting
such a discrepancy as that, but that&#8217;s the way it
reads in Dr. Scott&#8217;s book and I have no reason
to think that the Brigade and Division reports
are erroneously printed in that book. It <i>might</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
give a wrong impression to a casual reader.
Some might not take the trouble to <i>see</i> that <i>no</i>
advance was made and held on the 11th of November.
The line was advanced to the northern
edge of Bois Frehaut on November 10th and
never receded so much as one foot for a single
instant. Few enough colored battalions had the
opportunity to prove their true worth. I do not
propose to leave a single cloud on the record of
the glorious <i>success</i> and <i>achievements</i> of <i>one</i>
colored battalion. This does not in the least
detract from the glory of other units but will
<i>add greatly</i> to the prestige and standing of colored
soldiers as a whole.</p>

<p>In another place the report of the general
commanding our Brigade says, page 154, Dr.
Scott&#8217;s book: &#8220;The commanding officers of
units making the attack, and also of the artillery,
were constantly stating that they were
hurried into these movements without proper
preparation. Had they been familiar with such
operations, the time allowed would have been
sufficient.&#8221; The Major General, commanding
the 92nd Division who made the Division report
on the operations of November 10th and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
11th says, page 162, same book: &#8220;The attack
was made on very brief preparation, too brief
in view of the strength of the enemy positions,
which were very strongly held.&#8221;</p>

<p>I told in the lecture what the Second Battalion
of the Three Hundred and Sixth-fifth
Infantry had undergone in the Marbache Sector
and how we worked all of the night preceding
the attack on things that <i>had to be done</i>
regardless of familiarity with anything. I do
not remember that I made any complaints
about the shortness of time for preparation.
Possibly I did, for I was at all times doing anything
and everything to insure success against
the enemy. But whether the time was too short
or too long I again call your attention to the
fact that <i>this</i> battalion accomplished its mission,
fully, completely, magnificently, under
the guns of Metz.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel A. E. Deitsch, a veteran
of the Regular Army, who was my immediate
superior and was in command of our Regiment
during that drive, and who, before coming to
our Regiment, had served in other Divisions in
the battle line, said in a letter to me: &#8220;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
handling of your battalion during the ninth,
tenth and morning of November eleventh, 1918,
(which lead to the capture of Bois Frehaut)
could not, I believe, have been conducted any
better. As you well know the capture of
this position is credited to you and your battalion.&#8221;</p>

<p>On page 154, same book, the Brigade report,
speaking of the work of the Brigade as a whole,
says: &#8220;There is no doubt that some details of
the operation were not carried out as well as
might have been done by more experienced
troops. These were the results of mistaken
judgment due to lack of experience rather than
to lack of offensive spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is true of the Brigade as a whole and
the report from which it is copied is a very
general statement of the work of the <i>entire</i>
Brigade in that series of operations. I say and
have shown and am ready to prove more exhaustively
if necessary that the above statement
does not concern <i>one</i> of the six infantry battalions
of that Brigade, namely, the Second
Battalion, Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth.</p>

<p>Suppose I should admit or should say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the battalion that captured this seemingly impregnable
position and held it continuously
under the defenses of Metz, was only a very
mediocre battalion, or suppose I should admit
or should say, &#8220;Oh, yes, the men were anxious
enough and after they got going fought savagely
with razors or knives or bayonets, but
the colored officers had no judgment and could
not handle their men and it was a pretty poor
battalion.&#8221; What then could be said, what
would <i>have</i> to be said of the <i>other</i> units of the
Ninety-second Division and of units engaged
of the Seventh Division that <i>failed</i> utterly to
accomplish their missions during the same attack?</p>

<p>The truth is that those other battalions and
units that failed to advance and hold against
the world&#8217;s strongest position&mdash;Metz&mdash;were
excellent troops and in many instances did
most heroic work. They were fully equal on
the average to battalions and units of the foremost
American Divisions. The truth is equally
clear to every one who knows or <i>wants</i> to know
that the Second Battalion of the Three Hundred
and Sixty-fifth Infantry was a most <i>exceptional</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a most <i>wonderful</i> battalion, fully
equal in <i>all</i> respects to the very finest battalions
in the American Army or any army that fought
in the Great World War. I challenge any one
to disprove this statement.</p>

<p>They <i>were</i> wonderful fighters with the trench
knife and bayonet, but they were equally efficient
and energetic with all other infantry arms.
Take the other extreme from fighting&mdash;paper
work. The paper work that had to be done in
a company of our army was staggering. It
required ceaseless work and absolute accuracy.
The companies of this battalion were unsurpassed.
&#8220;H&#8221; Company, for instance, as is well
known, did and turned in paper work that was
practically perfect at all times. Then there
was march or road discipline. Some of the
marches made were very trying. As an example,
the Second Battalion of the Three Hundred
and Sixty-fifth Infantry marched from
Camp d&#8217;Italien in the Argonne Forest to Camp
Cabaud north east of Les Isilett during the
night, through mud and through the confusion
and blockade of traffic you have all heard about,
just preceding the Argonne Offensive, and <i>arrived</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
with every man who started. <i>Not one
straggler.</i> I furnished signed certificates before
it could be believed by my superiors. I
have already referred to the very significant
fact that no officers were ever placed under
arrest or sent before efficiency boards. Every
statement I have made and every inference I
have drawn is based on a personal knowledge of
<i>facts</i>.</p>

<p>My efforts to make that Battalion a real
success were due solely to the fact that it was
an American Battalion engaged in the fight
against our Nation&#8217;s enemies. My enlisted men
were colored and they wore the American uniform.
My Officers were colored and they were
commissioned, <i>not by me, but by the United
States Government</i>. If you are colored or if
perchance you are white and care to do some
thinking about me and about my Battalion
and about many things in general, read on
pages 433 and 438 of the book I have been
referring to. By the way, the Battalion Commander
there referred to relieved me (he was
then a Lieutenant Colonel) of the command of
the Regiment (Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Infantry) the second day after the Armistice
took effect.</p>

<p>It is my idea of justice that the race&mdash;namely
the American Negro&mdash;that produced men
who served their country so loyally, so bravely,
so capably both as officers and as enlisted men
under my command, should <i>know the truth</i>
about my battalion. It would matter little
whether the outfit were a division, a brigade
or a battalion. It happens to have been a battalion.
And it matters little <i>what</i> colored battalion
it was, but it does matter a great deal
and mean a great deal to Colored Americans
that one of the very finest and greatest battalions
in the American Army and in the world
was an American <i>colored</i> battalion.</p>

<p>If what I have said about my Colored Battalion
shall in any way aid, or shall inspire and
stimulate Colored Americans in their struggle
for advancement and for the attainment of
Righteousness that &#8220;Exalteth a nation,&#8221; I
shall be gratified.</p>

<p>The following is the <i>testimonial</i> I referred
to. It substantiates some things spoken of in
the lecture.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p class="right"><span class="gapright">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters 365th Infantry.</span></span></p>

<p>Major Warner A. Ross, 365th Infantry,
commander of the 2nd Battalion, while leading
his battalion and part of the First Battalion
into action in the &#8220;Bois Frehaut&#8221; on the east
bank of the Moselle River north of Pont-a-Musson
and under the guns of Metz, on the
morning of November 10th, 1918, with Brigade
orders to capture and hold this strong German
position, displayed most exceptional bravery,
coolness and efficiency under heavy fire. He
personally led his forces and established his
first waves in their firing position in no-man&#8217;s
land immediately in front of the enemy&#8217;s observers,
machine gunners and snipers. He
then, after encouraging his men through enemy
wire, under heavy barrage established his Post
of Command in the edge of the &#8220;Bois Frehaut&#8221;
in what just before was enemy territory. This
Post of Command was a shell hole with no
protection from artillery fire and was established
in this place so that runners coming back
from platoons and companies could follow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
edge of the wood and easily find him. This
he maintained as his P. C. until 10:30 o&#8217;clock
on the morning of the 11th, when news of the
Armistice reached him.</p>

<p>Major Ross refused to move his Headquarters
despite the fact that a hostile plane had
located it and that others abandoned it. Shrapnel
burst over it and high explosive shells tore
great holes all around it. The sides were caved
in and he was once almost completely buried.
During the night it became filled with mustard
gas. He ordered lime sprinkled in it and a fire
built and remained. By moving to a less exposed
position or to a dugout his liaison would
have been impaired. It was excellent liaison
that enabled him to send in reinforcements to
meet counter attacks and flank movements attempted
by the enemy.</p>

<p>The bravery of Major Ross and his indifference
to personal safety in his determination to
win this battle are considered worthy of special
recognition. Such conduct is far in excess of
the ordinary line of duty of a Battalion Commander.
The &#8220;Bois Frehaut,&#8221; &#8220;Belle Aire
Ferme,&#8221; &#8220;Ferme de Pence&#8221; and &#8220;Bois de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
tete d&#8217;Or&#8221; were taken from the enemy and the
battle line changed by this victory.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
